I have tried to reignite an interest in coding, but I just feel so uninterested and defeated.The reason why I particularly like film is because you get to create content in our increasingly consumerism-centric society. I also want to work on comic adaptations, because I just love these storiesMany people in life, they encourage you to chase your passion, and I want to, but I feel like work experience is much more useful to get myself into the film industry. I seriously have little faith in the film school route, what if I spend 3-5 years getting a film degree and still struggling to find a job, especially in my country where the film industry is tinyAlso, since the film industry here is so tiny, coming across opportunities to work in the film industry after my 2 years of army service...seems hardI just feel so empty.

At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond exhausted. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. Decided to go out of my comfort zone and try out dating, the dude I briefly talked to turned out to also was similar. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS got out of control. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. COVID is still very much flourishing. What are the fucking odds. Every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people in my life, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. I want to move out, but I know that that is going to be financially irresponsible of me. I need to be there for myself, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but I am so close to just crashing.

27134,"I am a 16 year old girl who is been struggling with seasonal depression and anxiety all my life. it is always been a cycle where the anxiety goes away in the winter but the depression becomes worse and in the summer the depression becomes easier but I get quite a lot of anxiety. Since 4 years back I also have feelings of unreality (possibly derealization but I am being treated for just depression right now) and it makes my life feel completely meaningless. I struggle with school, mostly because I cannot see myself living long enough to get a job so I do not really have a lot of motivation. I have tried to talk to my parents about it since I was very little, but they did not take my mental health seriously until I started cutting myself, which I later swapped out for binge eating when my parents confronted me about it and made me go to therapy. I have a great psychologist now and I take 2 kinds of antidepressants daily, but I am not going to see my psychologist until august.In december, the day after my 16th birthday my dad got me a job. I only accepted it to not dissapoint my parents, and when I look back at it it was really stupid of them to get me a job when I was barely managing to pass school. The job is being a supermarket clerk... I basically go around unpacking stuff and putting them in their place. It would be alright if I at least had someone to talk to. But I have social anxiety and everyone who works there are either ""cool kids"" or a lot older than me. I do not have any friends, not even internet friends. My top 3 friends are 1. My oldest cat 2. My brother 3. The two other cats. So I guess you can see how I cannot talk to people. I have had friends and even a boyfriend in the past, but I cannot seem to remember how I even got them. Anyways, I hate just being alone with my thoughts, which is what happens for 5 hours straight at my job. I do not even talk to customers unless it is just saying hi or helping them find something in the store.I am willing to get another part-time job as long as I get to pick it. Photography is the only thing I am proud of and I am thinking about going full-time trying to be the best Photographer I can. But just working at a caf or something would be a lot nicer.

22867,"Because every positive thought is fleeting. Sadness and resentment are forever. They fill me like a sinking ship as I dwell in them. People keep telling me to act before I think. To just do. And I think its stupid advice. Its stupid to assume that just by forcing myself to get up and do the things I have dedicated myself to doing is going to change anything. I spend hours practicing guitar and I hardly get anywhere. I learn a song and practice it for weeks only to discover I am still to anxious to play in front of my closest friends. I still do not have the muscle memory that I keep plucking painfully at the guitar to get. If I were to do instead of think, I would be dead. I would have killed myself because that is what I want to do half the time.

34035,"Second opinion for cancer? Hey there.

I'm a 24 y/o female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well, but this was the one I could feel from the outside.

The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP (although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up) for early January, so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.

I've also found that my cough has gotten worse despite not having any other ""cold"" symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, etc) as well as I am finding myself very short of breath with a chronic pinching/squeezing sensation below where my bra band sits. My doctor ordered a pulmonary function test and we are waiting for results. I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes. When I mentioned this to my doctor she didn't think anything of it (I thought I might be getting fevers at night from a bad flu or something).

I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned (as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound) have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time. Would you reccomend a second opinion? Seeing if the lymph nodes grow more?

I'd never seen the website before in my life, but it was suddenly not only the promoted result *and* the top non-promoted result when I googled a generic symptoms (I know, googling bad). I clicked out of curiosity, seemed like an innocuous anxiety website, it directed me to a test, which then offered to send me in-depth results via email (no), or I could get basic results, which I clicked. Then a long-ass video with a woman promising she could cure me in just a few weeks, no meds, no therapy! It was really deceptive because the video suggested she would tell you the solution at any moment, but eventually she asked for $78. It was an obvious scam (to me) and I knew that from the start, but it was really well crafted. I doubt anyone here would fall for that sort of thing, but if you see calm clinic in Google results, click on the feedback button to report it as a scam. :) I think at one point the woman insinuated that if you thought the whole deal was too good to be true, that also was your anxiety lol.

I am nearly 30 now and have a dead-end job that, while I technically make enough to get by without my parent's assistance (whom I currently live with), I would not be able to save any money and I fear I have capped out how much I can make with my educational background (that is to say, no educational background). What is there to do in this situation? I have no friends, no relationship, I have my parents and 2 siblings and a few people online I chat with from time to time.

19470,"When people talk about depression its usually about the sadness part, or loss of interest, and distancing. But one big factor of it is the loneliness. That feeling that you are alone. No matter how loving friends and family are and supportive, that loneliness is still there. It eats at you, making your self consciousness to kick in. Making you hate yourself, making you think that you are a failure, that no one will ever love you. It truly hurts. Its an emptiness inside you that you feel cannot be filled. Nothing takes away this pain for long. Its tiring, and draining. I want to curl up in a ball and cry, but i cannot. I have to fake it. Fake being happy, fake being warm and fuzzy. Fake a smile, fake enjoyment. Fake everything. I just want it to end. I just want to stop feeling so alone in this world. I just want to feel loved and appreciated. I want to be understood. I want to be cared for. But my mind will not let me reach out to people. It will not let me get the help i need. I always hold back the truth. No matter who I am talking too.

Doctor ordered some blood work to test for mono but to only go through with it if my condition worsens

All day today I was extremely tired. Had to stay up to write a final essay but then around 3 am I start shaking uncontrollably (chills) and was burning up.

I’m too scared to go to bed because I’m worried my fever will skyrocket and I’ll die in my sleep

I’ve been so good with my health anxiety lately and now this just randomly came along :( these are the only 2 outcomes in my head:
1) I either have mono which I actually wouldn’t be too nervous about because then at least I know what’s wrong
2) I have cancer

15004,"really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong, and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing/ glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool, but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again, i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good, how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all, but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. I have begged my parents to quit and they will not let me. idk what to do. am i in the wrong (therapy)?",Suicidal,really feel like therapy working sure one wrong trying look perspectives please help

many times refuse let switch say worked hundreds kids best city year half much worse blame mostly due mental illness offered help support made feel worse never felt like clicked feel like understand trying say talk feel tells wrong ljke telling thinks feel instead listening talk constantly gets mad trying hard enough even though repeatedly told hard struggle social anxiety hard open strangers often asks anything would like talk gets mad say even though told anxious bring subjects talk feel scared saying wrong things react deems trying hard enough gets parents involved tells strict even though knows best relationship past made things worse finish homework maximum effort still complains trying think trying calls spoiled selfish using resources given totally understand lucky parents afford care enough put therapy called spoiled selfish trying even though sends downward spiral self hatred makes depression much worse tell suicidal thoughts says glamourizing glorifying death think cool rlly invalidating basically saying suicidal attention think cool try calmly explain think cool feel trapped see way much unbearable pain cannot survive anymore tells think glamorizing upsets tells choose happiness get coming know choosing positive mindset important beating depression tell rlly hard matter hard try happy end even miserable tells fault trying hard enough wanted positive happy would constantly points flaws therapeutic way like starts session always says hey said good polite says ugh supposed say tell week say even try keep going tell parents trying also thing currently bothering trying discuss disorder firstly brought said could reject diagnosis non verbal learning disorder told mom teachers get multiple perspectives everyone talked parents teachers etc said sound like meet none criteria talked said hey really feel like fit open diagnosis would love hear think nvld would love diagnosed get treatment want misdiagnosed especially one knows thinks symptoms tried listen open mind things said complete bullshit like went symptoms list said things completely false like things never happened refused listen told happened example last november rock bottom suicidal failing school parents switched small private school ten kids grade angry also top kids actually insane first day one lied sandy hook another followed parking garage anyways angry sad instead hanging kids lunch break went pharmacy bought bottles pills could try kill spent majority lunch breaks loooking ways places kill time family unsupportive allowed see friends going much anyways therapist brought said kids nvld often loners isolate socially awkward going lunch shows behavior l said literally trying kill going use example like think fair use evidence nvld examples like like literally solid evidence one else actually knows thinks disorder complete bullshit real reasons fine fair use lies make claim instead listening feel like would way helpful productive could explain brain works interpret things tells aligns nvld try says yeah seem like nvld still think like asks question say know like put spot says understanding broad concepts automatically nvld frustrating told done much research watched many videos people talking experiences nvld affects relate none listen mom done thing also says see relates good reading social cues know say good making friends grasp

8606,"My GF suffers from bad depression. She had become very distant and to me it felt like she was pushing me away. She started a new job and went really quiet. I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space, but idk why she would of thought that.

35334,"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

9138,"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone &lt;3",Depression,hi relate deeply lot posts see page would like offer encouragement long period time complete isolation pandemic isolated turned negative things cope depression loneliness like mind numbing television alcohol hanging people toxic due fear alone years therapy growth wanted share words encouragement lonely hearts lt afraid alone totally normal reason may feel alone sharing anyone feelings seen heard way need seen heard hope post helps connect way know alone many others gone similar thing growing love respect someone else requires time spent person time may fall love grow great respect people show value talk act etc difference growing self love amp self respect must spend time grow love respect alone time seen opportunity look way feel less alone meditating minutes day journaling shadow work exercises help shadow work exercise really helped learned spiritual journey therapy look mirror ask questions surprised comes start hobbies anything everything afford ends flopping okay move onto next thing remember time time hopefully realize time alone gives opportunity want recharge protect energy people quick defend others talking negatively e g friend says ugly fat worthless immediately tell give plethora compliments negate negative self talk feed feed must kind must defend tell bad day know get better things helped along journey feeling lonely hope things help lt tldr youtube video regarding topics go video first tell story go pros benefits spending time alone finish friendly suggestions alone find video searching kelly guidance stop feeling alone spiritual chat never alone sending much love light remember always kind others one day time friendly suggestions anyone feels alone lt,Hi Relate နက်နက်ရှိုင်းရှိုင်းစာတန်းများကိုကြည့်ပါ။ Page Says Healty Insolual The HeVery Insolving The Heavy Hearting The Hevision Hearting The Healty Hearting The Healty Hearts သည်အထီးကျန်ခြင်းကိုမျှဝေရန်လိုသည်။ ချစ်ခြင်းမေတ္တာကြီးမြတ်သောလေးစားမှုကြီးမြတ်သောလေးစားမှုသည်တန်ဖိုးပြေးခြင်းဆိုင်ရာပြ adds နာကိုပြသခြင်း amp ကိုယ့်ကိုယ်ကိုလေးစားမှုသည်အခွင့်အလမ်းများအား လွဲ. 0 န်ဆောင်မှုပေးသောအရာသည်အခွင့်အလမ်းများအား 0 န်ဆောင်မှုပေးသောအရာများကိုပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်စွာကြည့်ရှုရန်မျှော်လင့်ချက်ကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်းက အသည်းအသန်အဆီမဲ့အချည်းနှီးသောအချည်းနှီးသောအရာအား Plethora တို့အားအညစ်အကြေးများနှင့်ပတ်သက်သောအညစ်အကြေးများနှင့်ပတ်သက်သော LT Tldr YouTube Video Heart MoSy MoS ကိုတစ် ဦး တည်းသောမျှော်လင့်ခြင်း

12300,"So...HI I am Emma a young trans woman from germany. I am 18 years old and I do not know if i even want to live anymore. A lithle bit of backstory: I growed up in a small catholic village in the middle of nowhare. In school I had big social issues and was just a loner and I was pritty depressed. After school I just got home and watched TV the rest of the day or playd on console and I basicly wasted my whole childhood alone and depressed. My (family) just neclected me and left me alone. Later after I finished school I was just a mental wreck with absolutly no social skills. I dident realy know what to do so I did a BVB that is something like a bridge year to get you ready to learn a job. Around that time a lot of things cleared up in my mind. I aknowledegd that I am trans but still dident do mutch about it beciuse I know that my family would hate me even more and I should wait till i can move out. I lost around 20kg ( I was obese) and actually had social interaction in the BVB i actually made friends i guess. Then the second wafe of corona hit and the BVB stopped vor over six months and we just got some stuff to do per E-Mail. I was stuck at home whit my Family that i do not talk with and I lost contact with the persons I met. I sunk into a deep depression and the Dysphoria ( Stuff that i hate about myself becouse of gender related stuff) just got whorse and I just wanted to end my stupid useless live. I dident self harm myself I wanted to die whitout pain. I dident have acess to medication so I just wanted to cutt my wrist and blead out.... Sometimes I sat there houres whit a fucking kitchen knive in my hand but diden had the guts to just do it. I do not know if its good or bad that I dident do it. My existance just sucked. I kind of opend up about my mum that live is hell for me and i asked her if i could see a terapist, surprisingly she was okay with that. I got to a terapist and kind of tould her everything... Becouse I tould her that i was suecidial i got put into a psychosomatic facility that I stayd for two months. They kind of saved my live in a view ways to be honest. It was the first time in my live that everything seems to be okay. I turned 18 during my stay there. I am now kind of mentaly stable again. They helped ne to get back in kontakt whit my dad. (My parents divorced when I was 3.) and I moved to him directly after I got relesed. That was two weeks ago. My family cut contact with me becouse I moved to there ""enemy"" and I do not realy care tbh. I am proberbly going to do something like a BVB again now and I am proberbly seeking ambulant terapy so i can figure myself out and actually start HRT. I still have a lot of anxiety. But I can at least go shopping and can talk to strangers. The mascs actually realy help! I just have a lot of fear for my future and coud just need some advise. To be honest I do not realy know abaut what. I just feel lost. And I know that so many people got it so mutch whorse but I guess my live has at least some importance at least to me.I hope that what i wrode made at least some sence and I am sorry if my grammer is bad.

11543,"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t",Depression,anxiety depression mental illness much life able get proper treatment local mental health clinic ways helped immensely able get pure obsessional ocd control longer bad symptoms still definitely sometimes flares bit faded background noise part ways mental health significantly deteriorated mid completely lost self confidence gained time college found tribe got better art skills could finish college drop due mental illness adhd trying get freelance artist mostly living disability though able earn anything close living wage would attempted without financial aid government would living parents parents supported god knows would would probably homeless know happened college friend mine parents support artistic pursuits quit school would kicked mental health bad shape several years since completely incapacitated co morbid disorders dealing severe social anxiety agoraphobia body dysmorphic disorder well adhd autism spectrum disorder also c ptsd parents drive everywhere driving terrifies cannot even call taxi social anxiety c ptsd makes terrified space people know quick exit sitting taxi driver would mean would unable escape easily turned mean know highly unlikely still scares friend one experience mean taxi driver late teens crazy idea trying drawing art video blog seems lucrative tubers earn passive income think would great instead relying government financial aid want think would good actually seems impossible even though decent drawing skills people skills socially handicapped mental disorders one main reasons draw hard time talking people drawing helps make feel comfortable around idea would ever feel comfortable enough talk camera scare people away want insincere fake pretend talkative bubbly actually thought voice changer thing captions talking scares hell scared voice name recognized bullies stalked harassed real life online may try one video perhaps even post get feel work bother multi skilled vocation art vlogger also good people skills well video making skills hate idea video blogging hope earning money hating people like youtuber genuinely friendly acknowledges followers would want put people unfriendliness social anxiety responding comments messages turning comments really know cut existence feel powerless mess know prevent life going sh,စိုးရိမ်ပူပန်မှုစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျခြင်းစိတ်ဓာတ်နာမကျန်းမှုများအပြည့်အဝမသန်စွမ်းသောရောဂါလက္ခဏာများကိုပိုမိုဆိုးရှားသွားသောစိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာရောဂါများကိုပိုမိုဆိုးရှားစွာဖြင့်ပိုမိုဆိုးရှားသွားသည့်စိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာရောဂါများကိုပိုမိုဆိုးရှားစွာခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ knows would would probably homeless know happened college friend mine parents support artistic pursuits quit school would kicked mental health bad shape several years since completely incapacitated co morbid disorders dealing severe social anxiety agoraphobia body dysmorphic disorder well adhd autism spectrum disorder also c ptsd parents drive everywhere driving terrifies cannot even call taxi social anxiety c ptsd makes terrified space people know quick exit sitting taxi driver would အလွယ်တကူမထွက်ခွာမီမလွတ်မြောက်နိုင်ပါ။ အဆိုးဝါးဝါးသောအရာများမှာအယူဖောက်ပြန်မှုစွမ်းရည်ကိုဆွဲဆောင်နိုင်သည့်အရာများအကြောင်းဆွဲဆောင်နိုင်သည့်အခက်အခဲများက 0 င်ရောက်နိုင်သည့်အတွက်အကျိုးအမြတ်များသောအကြောင်းအရင်းမှာစိတ်လှုပ်ရှားစရာကောင်းသောအတွေးအခေါ်များကိုတွေးတောဆင်ခြင်ခြင်းသည်စိတ်ရှုပ်စရာကောင်းလောက်အောင်လုပ်ခြင်းကိုဆိုလိုသည်။ Voice Changer အရာသည်လက်တွေ့ကျသောအညစ်အကြေးများဖြစ်သောအနှောင့်အယှက်ဖြစ်သူ Multies Multues Multues Multies Multies Multues Supporting Multies Multies Multments Multies Schairs of Multies Multies Smaceting Multiples Multys Multiples Motions Motion Smallely Mession Smallely Motion Smallely Motion Motion Smallely Mession Smallely Motion Support Smaceting Myanmar Repects Repects Reps Repects ဆိုတာဘာလဲ powerless meth သည်ဘဝကိုပုံမှန်အားဖြင့်ကာကွယ်တားဆီး

My whole teen life was thrown away with sitting in front of a rectangle screen and wasting life. Now I realized that life brings joy with good friends and meeting each other. Fuck man, I have never experienced that! Everytime I go to the city I see groups of people and then there is me, awkwardly going alone through the streets... Of course there is my older brother, who has a good paying job, a wife, good friends and he even moved 3 times already! And there is me, 18 years old, finished highschool and I am scared of job life. In 4 days I should be applied to studying something and I know that I cannot do it.

Probably because of my childhood and a lot of violence between my parents. (Coming from my father, mother was an angel) A father slapping his wife into the bathtub was not rare sight for me. Last year my mother died because of glioblastoma. It hit hard and fast, around a month after the first symptoms hit she died in the hospital. My brother and i decided to let her go, after she fell asleep in a operation. (do not know the right word, it was basicaly an 'awake operation' where they tried to reduce the tumor). She went into a coma afterwards and never woke up again.Now, I have seen my best friend, my mother die from that. I visited her as often as i could and felt like she reacted to my voice. A few days before her death there was none of that. She was simply sleeping, connectes to all the machines. I hated that sight, it crushed me. The day of the funeral i had so much anger in me. I was angry at life, at my father. She did not deserve that. I know that there are worse cases, i know all of that. But after all, she was my mother and my best friend. So much for the prologue. A month after her death i got a pulse synchronized (?) Tinnitus. Basically a whooshing sound to the beat of my heart. I got heavy dizzy spells and could not walk. Went to my doc, got my blood checked, CT done, 24 hour heart rate measured and what not. Everything is 'fine'.And most of all i feel so foggy. Literally 24/7 for a year now. It feels like I am hanging on a thread of conciousness. I am just not 'here'. My forehead feels tingly when i move it. I do not know anymore. Is it Depression, trauma?

I’m 27F, very fit, never smoked, had the radon tested in my house last fall, it wasn’t optimal but was well within safe range, never been exposed to asbestos that i know of, no family history of cancer. About a month ago I started having upper respiratory symptoms, first shortness of breath and chest tightness that led to a cough. then i started having heart palpitations so i went to my PCP. she did an EKG which was normal and listened to my lungs and said they sounded clear. My cough cleared up after a couple days and I started getting back to normal but my anxiety was still nagging at me.

About a week after my doctor’s visit, I woke up from a nap totally unable to breathe and my blood pressure was very high so I went to the urgent care. they ran the full gambit of tests on me which all came back fine - EKG, blood work, chest x-ray, all normal. The doc said my lungs sounded clear. Figured it was a panic attack.

I felt okay for a day or two but my heart palpitations persisted and I still felt short of breath. I emailed my doctor and she ordered a bunch more blood tests which have all come back normal except for my blood calcium which was .2 above range. This is freaking me out because I read that high blood calcium can be caused by cancer. I’m doing a 24 hour urine test on Monday and then will have another appointment to talk about the results. I want to ask my doc for a chest CT but I feel so stupid asking for something like that just because I’ve been feeling vaguely out of breath.

34853,"This has become devastating. m(24)So. I’ve always been a worrier. Worried about everything since I was little. I’ve struggled with OCD, and anxious thoughts for a long time. However, it seems that since a ER visit in the summer, I’ve been super aware of aches and pains more than I have in the past. It had led me down a road of constant deliberations on my own health. I have dealt with chest pain, lower-extremity pain, and seemingly much more. 

December was a rough month for me. A lot of stress about jobs and life changes. However, it seemed my health anxiety became insane. Heartburn ruined my Christmas. I have become so anxious. 

However, I am seemingly now facing my biggest challenge yet. For about a week now, possibly two. I have felt a small fluttering in my right abdomen. I have also been bloated and am constipated. I think it’s important to mention, I am not the best eater. Missing meals, not eating enough, eating one large meal a day, reliance on cereal. However, I went to see the doctor and she had said it was constipation. She prescribed some glyencol and said to up my fiber, and improve my diet. However, my intestines in the last three days have begun to contract or spasm. Almost like waves reverberating inside me. It’s not entirely stopping me from living, but it’s simply awful to feel. So now I fear the worst. I just want to live my life. The saddest part about HA is the fear that something could be wrong. I just needed to vent. This subreddit has been helpful. Thank you.

I was never able to get them to go away, but when I would feel them I would feel like I had my own reason why behind it. It was not until after high school that the thoughts grew into more serious and detailed descriptions of acts that my brain would actively play for me as I would think about them.

35306,"What triggers your palpitations and what do they feel like? So I’ve been dealing with intermittent palpitations for the past 6 months or so. I haven’t had an EKG done yet just because I’m in between doctors and my psychiatrist (MD not therapist) said she wasn’t worried about them and thought they were fine when I told her about them. 
From what she told me and what I’ve learned, I think I’ve been feeling ectopic beats. For me, it feels kind of like my stomach drops- like when you’re in an elevator going down. I can also feel like the air is pushed out of my lungs and I feel a super faint little tap in my chest, then my heartbeat goes back to normal. I sometimes feel adrenaline and lightheadedness right when it first happens, but I’m not sure if that’s a physical response to the palpitation or if it’s my anxiety reacting. I’ve never felt a run of any, it’s always just a single missed beat that I feel (when they’re bad I get 3-5 per day at most). I’ve been trying really hard to figure out what triggers them for me, and it seems to be correlated with breathing variance, stress, and posture. For instance, I feel them most often if I’m talking quickly and run low on breath and then take in a quick breath. I also feel them sometimes when bending over or bending backward.  Also, if I’ve been sitting down and then stand up and stretch I can feel a tightness in my whole chest area and my heart will beat slow and hard and I can feel an ectopic if I move too quickly or breathe weird during this. I wanted to know if anyone else has these same triggers, and if not then what are they and how do the palps feel? I’m working on not worrying so much about mine, but it’s comforting to know other people experience similar things.

I have had episodes like this since I was a teen and now I am 40 years old. it is exhausting having to feel all this emotion. At least I am not numb, I guess. But how much more do I have to cry until I am finally done? I feel lost in my life. I am at a point where I need to make some decisions. Where to live, what direction to take my career. (Do I even want a career?) I do not have a partner. I have developed feelings for someone who only wants a casual FWB type involvement. I have gone along with it because I do not have many other options, but it is making me feel bad. I want and think I do deserve more. I am angry at myself for again allowing myself to be taken advantage of by an emotionally unavailable man. I knew exactly what I was getting into, but a part of me foolishly thought he would change his mind at some point and want the kind of relationship I want. So, I feel the need to end that and move on. I am just not made for casual involvements like that. I quit drinking alcohol 73 days ago. I have been completely sober. it is been a positive change but now I am feeling everything without any buffer. I have been in and out of therapy since age 18 or so.

So annoyed with myself, even though I guess it isn’t really my fault, I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago. It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump, it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. I’ve been in the US for almost two years now and haven’t really had any ‘big’ health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me, I guess some sort of virus, and I had flu like symptoms - of course, a lymph node on my neck has swollen - as is pretty topical with stuff like that - and I’m now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week, unbelievable. This time feels different though, when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario, but this time I’m well aware how irrational I’m being, and I’m well aware that it’s most likely just due to this infection. But I’m still worrying. I made the mistake of Googling it, and although Google does say that with cancerous lumps in the neck they’re typically immovable, mine is movable, I’m still panicking!",Anxiety,annoyed health anxiety resurgence hey guys annoyed even though guess really fault used pretty bad health anxiety years ago started subside somewhat got scan done felt lump cyst right around time also immigrating uk us life got super busy health anxiety virtually went away us almost two years really big health worries since got scan done england years ago week wife passed onto guess sort virus flu like symptoms course lymph node neck swollen pretty topical stuff like convinced lymphoma week unbelievable time feels different though sort stuff happened past rational thought completely obscured point logical rational thought would immediately dismissed favor worst case scenario time well aware irrational well aware likely due infection still worrying made mistake googling although google say cancerous lumps neck typically immovable mine movable still panicking,စိတ်ဆိုးနေသောကျန်းမာရေးစိုးရိမ်ပူပန်မှုပြန်လည်ထူထောင်ရေးတွင်အမှန်တကယ်အမှားများကိုစိတ်ဆိုးစေခဲ့သည်။ တစ်ပတ်မျှမယုံနိုင်စရာအချိန်သည်အတိတ်သိတ္င်သောဆင်ခြင်တုံတရားမှားယွင်းသောအတွေးအခေါ်ကိုချက်ချင်းပယ်ဖျက်လိုက်ခြင်းသည်အဆိုးရှားဆုံးသောရောဂါပိုးကူးစက်မှုသည်ပုံမှန်အားဖြင့်စိုးရိမ်ပူပန်စရာဖြစ်နေသေးကြောင်းသတိထားမိသည်။

18210,"Ill do my best to keep this concise, but I think context is important. I am 24, and I lost my way big time.I moved back home 8 months ago, working a remote job that pays really decent money for the country I live in. Its an uninspiring job, but its fine. I do not love or hate it. I also found my passion a year and a half ago writing. It consumed me. Every bit of spare energy I have goes into it, and a lot of time. But there is big missing piece. I want to start my own family, meet someone nice and settle down. Thing is, after a 5-year relationship that started in highschool, I spent the last 3 years single, which makes for a total of 8 years since I have been on a first date. I have no idea how that works now, but I had my writing excuse. My bubble.I told myself everything can wait until I am published. Writing comes first. And for a long time, I was happy with that, and hopeful. It does not work because you are not trying, duh.Something changed a few weeks back. I realised that was an excuse more than anything, and, when the opportunity arose, I tried to flirt. Be nice, hang out. Still have no idea how this works and my confidence was at an all time low going into this, so I am not surprised I failed. But here is the kicker. After a long introspection, I realised that, for the last few years, I have been feeling inadequate. Despite having a good job, passions, and being in pretty decent shape, my life is off the script.After uni, I have finally been free to make my own choices real choices. So there is no road map, and there is no way to feel adequate when there is no rules that define it. I tried seeing this in a positive light, but all I get is more dread and fear of something. I am on a downward spiral. I have been to bad mental places before, and I can feel it coming. That choking sensation when I go to bed. The random things that make you want to cry for no apparent reason. The mental exhaustion. I am not great, headed for the bottom of the pit.there is a question in there somewhere. I do not know what it is, but I hope you have some kind of answer. If you made it this far, thank you!

18735,"I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I did not have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this will not last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive. And growing up I navely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult did not even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I did not expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed. Now I am at a stage in life where I am still young, but I have managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I have gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I am scarred and damaged inside and out. I am a she will. I have gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I have destroyed so much I do not even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I cannot feel happiness, I cannot love. I cannot feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I am not considering suicide now, but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began, so I would not have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends.

I want to feel something other than inadequacy and pitifulness.Over the past few days I have come to the fact that I have an eating disorder, and I have been living with it for probably a little over 2 years and it has gotten progressively worse with age. I have also been thinking about how I talk to others. I have realised that I am too nice and I let people walk all over me, or I let mean comments pass by. I have decided I am not going to do that anymore, and when someone says something that I do not agree with, I am going to stand up for myself. I feel like a fraud.

I am an intellectual person and in my family I am a black sheep, because everyone around me is a lot more shallow than I when speaking about topics and they just like different things than me. So when I am around other people, it is better not to speak than to say something that does not fit their norm and be laughed at and made fun of.

24733,"I am going on a end of life journey tomorrow. I am texting every relative in my family this""As most of you may or may not know, I have asperger's and ADD, along with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have tried to live alone, and I have found working a fulltime job in a place I am unfamiliar with to be unbearable. For one, it is incredibly lonely being by myself even if I see family on the weekends to go to bed alone each night. Second, I am so depressed and have so many panic attacks about my predicament that it is getting hard to work a 40-hour-a-week job. Third, the pressure of being responsible for everything in my world with no help is overbearing. So I have decided to reach out to my phone contacts to see if anyone would let me live with them and get a part-time job in the area, and pay what I can for rent. I will wait 72 hours after sending this text to everyone while staying in an undisclosed location. If I do not get any offers, I will open a tank of \[redacted\] inside my car with me in it. If I get found and sent to the hospital, nothing will change - I will simply wait until insurance stops paying for me to be there, buy another tank of nitrogen, and do the same thing I set out to do. I cannot bear to go on. I already have 2 therapists and a psychiatrist - a hospital would be effectively less than that except I would not be able to do anything bad until I got out. I assume I will just either get ignored by everyone, a bunch of people being angry at me, or a bunch of people telling me to stop and trying to tell me how good my life is.

Nobody better tell me some stupid shit about loving your parents unconditionally because they did not love me that way. They could not even protect me. They betrayed me.

35420,"Hard lump in penis and doctor diagnosed as a cyst with no ultrasound or biopsy I discovered a hard lump in the middle of my penis. It seems pretty deep/internal (like close to the urethra) and not close to the skin. I have no pain and no symptoms, except a minor case of vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation) on my penis that started developing within the last year. No STDs. I saw my doctor and I feel like he brushed it off too easily. He said it's most likely a cyst, showed me a picture of an epidermoid cyst during his explanation, and said he just wants to monitor it (follow-up in 6 months) and take no further action (no ultrasound, biopsy, etc). My medical record was updated to say it's a cyst.

It's the VA and I don't know what their deal is but I guess they try hard to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. I just don't view it as unnecessary and expected him to order an ultrasound. I pushed back a little said it felt like gambling; the doc responded by saying the odds are against anything serious like penile cancer, I'm too young (31) and further action is unnecessary. On top of that, it's a resident who saw me, who had to confer with an attending for guidance/final approval, and the attending never saw me. The resident seemed inclined to order an ultrasound until he spoke to the attending who put the kibosh on that.

I acknowledge the odds of cancer are low, I just wonder what would happen if they encountered someone who had a genuine case of early-stage penile or urethral cancer. They'd be less likely to catch it at an early stage because they'd wait until it's symptomatic by bleeding, or blocking the urethra, etc. The potential negative consequences for them are nil, and the patient is the one who would be subjected to a penectomy or worse if it turned out they were too complacent.

I always wanted to be a doctor, but I did not got a medical seat in the entrance exam, so I joined the engineering college which I never liked in the first place, but I did not wanted to waste another year in repeating the medical entrance, so I joined the engineering course. I never got along with my teachers, as I was a student who came to the college via intercollege transfer from another engineering college, they never paid attention to me or helped me in the subjects. At the final year seminar, they purposely cut short my internal marks in that seminar. I had enough of that, they had already caused enough hurdles to me in those 3 years I had been there. I decided to not pursue that course. My 4 years of my life has been wasted. I sat another 3 years doing nothing. I was already depressed about not being completing the engineering course. I spend the next 3 years mourning about it. I sometimes feel like to try again for medical entrance one last time, but I do not have any energy left as I see my school friends has achieved a degree as well as a job in all these years and I am at the bottom trying to reach somewhere in life. Also, a lot of friends had been married or engaged and here I am 26 and reached nowhere. I feel like a utter failure. Sometimes, I feel like if I get a medical seat, by the time I complete it, I would be a 32 year old and who would marry a 32 year old woman in a conservative country, unless a divorcee or a widower with kids. On, the other hand my mom, is pushing me to get married and looking for grooms in matrimonial website for me, as I am ancient according to her as I am 26. Even, when I told her a thousand times that I am not mentally prepared to get married nor I like to live with in-laws she never listen to me. It makes me more depressed than I am already is. I always pray that I just die in my sleep and never wake up the next day. The only reason, I am not committing a suicide is because I do not want to be born again in this earth if reincarnation exist as I had cut short my life by suicide, then I will be born again to complete the remaining time I would have been alive in past life in the reincarnated life or if a life after death exists and I will not be allowed to meet my loved ones on the other side because I took my own life. I did not believe in things like this, but I came across a youtube channel called matt fraser a psychic medium and whatever I had learned from watching it is this that life after death exist and I do not want to take chances to not meeting my loved ones on the other side that is the only reason I am not taking my life.

Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. Pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends.

I was living with my grandma at that point and she thought I was tricking the doctor and was proud of me for doing such a good job at appearing sad. I was not faking it. My family were never big on mental health and its only recently that I got to discuss it with my mom. I am in college now and have been going to therapy for the past 2 years. Therapy is fine. I mostly attended the sessions when I was not having an episode, so basically, I have not attended one in the past 6 months. I mentioned how I started being more open with my mother about how I was feeling, she helped me pay for a trip to visit a friend. I was there for a month, helped a lot. I was ok for the two weeks after I got home and now- Its back to square 0. I feel ungrateful. I had a chaotic childhood growing up and it made sense how I was feeling then. It does not make sense how I am feeling now. I am surrounded by people I care for and doing the job I love, studying the shit I could give my life for. But instead- I waste my time, either eating or sleeping because they are the only two things I have energy for. Getting off my bed to go play a f- videogame is the highlight of my day. I have friends inviting me to go out, but looking at myself in the mirror, I do not think anyone should see me at this point. I cannot see myself, so why do I expect others. This is not how people know me. I am a workaholic. I am an extrovert. The friendly person that cleans up, helps, and does shit to make my mom proud.

This is pretty much the same reaction I have gotten from everyone in my life. Even my therapist has asked why it is so important to me that people ""understand"" how I am feeling.I do not need people to understand. I just need someone to care. it is deeply, deeply upsetting to me to think that it makes no difference to anyone in my life (besides me, obviously) whether I go through life constantly on the verge of suicide, taking meds, having panic attacks and sobbing alone on my floor every couple of days (as I have been since I was about eleven years old... I am now 25.) or whether I go through life feeling generally content and loved--just so long as I am functional and do not take up too much space with my emotions.Every time I try to talk about how I feel, I get shut down, the subject gets changed, the other person starts complaining about their own life, or I am told that I am upsetting them. When I was fourteen, I told my friend that I was cutting myself, she told our priest, and the priest CALLED THE POLICE and my parents and had me detained until I swore up and down that I would never, ever do it ever again (of course I did lmao. I still do sometimes.) That was the most extreme reaction I ever got, but others have been similar. I had someone I would been in a relationship with for MONTHS ghost me after I cried to them over the phone, for instance. I tried calling three different friends for help while I was hallucinating from alcohol withdrawal a little over a year ago, and literally Every Single One Of Them had a response like, ""Um... that really sucks... Good thing you are quitting, though. Okay, here is what happened to ME today--""it is just so frustrating. Even when you Google ""how to talk about your feelings,"" you will get a lot of results telling you that ""no one cares.""I do not know. It makes me want to end it sometimes. I am just so fucking sick of being all alone. I want to just LOSE IT and scream at everyone sometimes, but I do not think that would be fair. I know it is ultimately my responsibility to cope with my depression, but... I cannot. I just cannot do it without any support. I have been trying for so long.I have been in therapy for years. I take meds. I exercise. I eat healthy. I try to get enough sleep. And now I have been sober for about a year. I even tried to make a career change, but I have discovered I do not really want to do this, either (it is not the job. it is me. it is depression). I am just about ready to give up.Anyway.

I mean, nobody is perfect.However, when I raise the point that it is not a particularly nice thing to hear, I am met with ""Well I only said that because..."" essentially making it my fault.This hurt.

I do not feel human anymore because I cannot relate to or connect with anything that people say anymore. All I see is everyone elee living their lives while I have been stuck in the same position for years with no help. Whenever I see a couple togerher it really effects me because I have never had anything like that and I realized that other people do not care what you are goinf through, as long as they feel good they are content to ignore you. I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently. I watched as the years went by and everyone else in my family found a partner and got married. While other people found love I was here alone and I still am. This entire situation has had a terrible impact on my mental state. These days all I find myself doing is wasting the road at it my limited time and sleeping. When everyone else talks about their interests and hobbies all I can think of is oh that is nice, I wish I could afford to go out and do fun things. But since I do not have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay. Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while.

34475,"Ridiculously anxious about my teeth it’s making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought I’d search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. 

So yeah, I’ve had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago, I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad, any pain or symptom I panicked and I can’t even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 (I’m in the UK) and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. 

Everything has been fine until recently, under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home (for like the 15th time in the past 3 years). Ever since the stress, the HA has crept back in. Right now, I’m petrified and convinced that I’m going to lose my two front teeth. 

I haven’t been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I haven’t had it since. But I haven’t been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. I’m not even registered at a dentist, I’m going to call round tomorrow morning to register. 

My problem is, I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble, but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror (I think). It’s only slight and it’s not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But that’s enough to have convinced me that I’m doomed and my teeth will fall out.  I smoke so I think that’s contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I haven’t brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. 

Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search (awful I know, I promised myself I would stop doing this) and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header ‘I lost my front teeth!’ So that’s terrified me even more. 

My gums seem fine, they don’t hurt, they aren’t red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but that’s when im really rough at brushing. If I’m gentle and brush properly, no blood. I’m so terrified I’m already acting like they’ve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay, so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. I’ve been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I don’t have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. 

Sorry that this is so long. I’ve never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding, just acts like I’m annoying them. My family don’t get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back. 

Thank you all for reading. I hope that everyone is well. Any responses will be greatly appreciated.

I am just scared to.i want to spend time with my friends and enjoy it, but after an hour of doing so i often end up wanting to isolate and tackle boring statistics or learn about some ridiculous topic just to do something.i wanted to go to college for pharmacology. my knowledge on the subject broadens every day, and i employ it to help people as much as i can and its worked.i used to listen to music. now i skip 80% of the tracks in my playlist. i used to feel butterflies within me when i spent time with my girlfriend, but even though i love her with every last fiber of my being, it does not feel the same.i have a novel presently with ~50k words. i love my literary tongue, and i would love to pursue it, but i just do not.all i do is play that one video game and read.is anybody else amid an inertia like this? any kind of comment would make me feel good.

14586,"I apologize for such a long post, and I recognize that this may have been better in r/vent.it is just that all the time it is like I have a voice in my head telling me to just kill myself (not an actual voice, I do not hear voices that are not there). It feels redundant and pointless to say it, but yeah I have very serious depression. I had a therapist until May when my college closed, and I sought one earlier in the summer but kept getting anxiety about scheduling appointments. I have also tried getting a summer job but that is taken way longer than I would hoped. I did not want to schedule therapy which would conflict with my work schedule, so I was waiting till my work schedule was settled, but I still have not even done orientation yet. I am just so anxious about whether so many things will work out that I just freeze and wait for them not to. I am on Lexapro and while that was incredibly helpful a year ago, it does not feel like it is doing anything at all, maybe it is that I take it at a different time each day (late in the day too, I do not have the willpower to go to bed before 2:00 AM these days or wake up earlier than 2:00 PM)? Maybe I have not taken it for long enough?I just feel like I have totally lost the will to live. I do not want to die but I almost do not want to live either. My whole life I have been so depressed and the few times when I have felt genuinely happy just made me almost more depressed as I realized how rare it is for me to feel genuinely happy. The only things that really make me happy are my friends, my crush, Warhammer, and the occasional TV show. Everything else I ""enjoy"" is something that at best just makes me feel less awful. I do not have the energy for much of anything and I used to have other things i enjoyed they just do not bring me joy anymore.it is to the point that I am spending far more than is wise on Warhammer minis just because it is the only thing I have access to that does not make me want to kill myself. Modeling is one of the only things I get joy from, to build something with my hands as a creative pursuit to throw together stuff from different kits to make something my own with its own story I write. But I do not have the energy, patience, or willpower for painting anymore. So it all just ends up in various shades of grey.I have just been worn down by this depressing world to the point where I can hardly bear to be here anymore. So many people work SO hard and barely get a pittance. I am still passionate about my area of study (game design) but the job market is so competitive that I am unlikely to find work at all in that industry. I would consider a gap year or dropping out entirely but the friends I have made there are one of the only things that make me feel like staying, not to mention my crush there. I would consider changing major but that means more debt and I am less so much less passionate about other subjects. Every semester I say to myself ""this is the one, you will ask her out and try a relationship"" but there is always an obstacle. First it was fear of intimacy, then pandemic, fear of intimacy, and depression. I cannot conduct a relationship feeling like this, it is unfair to my partner, but the prospect of waiting or letting her leave my life seems nearly as bleak.TL;DR None of my dreams are attainable, the job market is too competitive, the world does not pay enough, and I cannot get my shit together for a relationship so the girl of my dreams is going to walk out of reach before I can do anything about it. I know when your back's against a wall all you are supposed to do is fight, but I am just tired. I am tired all the time.

Once every other week I call in sick to work because I do not see the point in making money that will not make me feel any better, my friends have all pushed me away to arms length because my mental health is getting to be too much for them, even playing with my cat who I love more than the world and who is helped me get through the bad times in the past is not doing me any good. There have been multiple times recently where the only reason I have not made an attempt is because I know there is no one who will take him and give him the love I do, but there have also been times where I have legitimately considered finding a new home for him so I can finally end things.Every other time I have felt this way I have kept going knowing that Id get through that phase and be happy again, at least more than I was in that moment, but there is just something different this time. there is some kind of finality engrained into this awful mood I am in and I do not know how to deal with it.

20037,"I am 17 and I have been depressed for almost as long as I can really remember. My last truly happy memory was probably when I was 5 and its laughably simple: just laying between my parents in bed as the weather played on an old TV. A couple years ago my last grandpa died and I felt nothing at all. It made me feel gross that I did not.This year I told my doctor I was depressed and wanted to die. They gave me a therapist and medication. I have only ever lied to my therapist since. I have told my doctor all medications I have taken feel like placebos and do absolutely nothing except give me erectile disfunction, this is the only true thing I have said. In the last few months things have really gotten worse. My only really close friend that I would have done anything for just stopped wanting to hangout. I have been planning on bringing him backpacking and rowing and every single time despite expressing interest pulls out at the last second and it really hurts me because I love them and want to do things. Then my boyfriend, the only person I have genuinely felt was the one for me, just stopped talking to me never officially breaking up but every time I try to talk to him he either goes quiet or gets irritable. It hurts so much because I love him so much and I genuinely wanted to spend the rest of my life with him and he had expressed that he felt similarly. And as of a month ago I have not a single friend. I have not really talked to anyone in a long while.Then this week my grandma died and again I felt nothing despite having seen her the most out of my grandparents. I feel like I am a selfish monster to not feel anything when my family dies but be so torn up when everyone else leaves. I just feel like I do not belong here. I just want to reset it all. I have planned on killing myself before and just could not go though with it that feeling of wanting to die never left I just cannot do it myself. I just wish Id die in some accident or something. Ill never be normal. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to rip my face off. I cannot even think without wanting to tear my brain out because of shear regret that I cannot just have a second chance. I hate myself and I do not even know why.

I should also add i've started taking Paxil again last tuesday after tapering off of it in January due to my anxiety.

27027,"I (33F) have been struggling with depression for quite some time. Back in 2019 I was seeing a psychiatrist as well as a therapist. I was taking Prozac to help with my depression. Overall I was beginning to feel good. Unfortunately, all that ended when my boss outsourced our jobs to India and I lost my insurance. Fast forward to the present, I am still without insurance and have not been able to afford therapy and meds on my own yet. My work has been really unsteady. With that said, I currently work 7 days a week, while my BF (36) works UberEats for 4-5 hours a day M-F. When I leave for work in the mornings, he is asleep. He does not start until 10:30 -11am. When I come home, I usually find him playing video games or on the bed on his phone watching porn or dumb shit. I do most of the cleaning at home, which includes washing dishes- to which I hate with a passion, but since I do not cook, that was our agreement. Lately though, I have been more active in the kitchen so I am considering switching our roles. Sex- He likes to be pegged. Which I happily do and enjoy. I genuinely get into the moment which tends to result in 2-3 orgasms for him. He has it good! I recently had this conversation with him expressing that I would like for him to initiate sex with me more often. However, our pose is usually 1 of the following 3; missionary, cowgirl, or stomach down/doggy. I can only orgasm with 2 of those positions. There is still a lack of initiation from his end. Maybe I should be more vocal... but I feel like at that point, it becomes a chore, which is not sexy. Plus how many times do I have to repeat it? that is the bad... the good is that he loves me. He tells me everyday how much he adores me. As far as I know, he is honest with me. Whatever I want, he does. he is supportive and encouraging. I love him. I do, but sometimes I also feel a little of resentment. Why am I breaking my back to fuck him and support our lifestyle. I have been so stressed out lately. Like I mentioned, my work has been pretty inconsistent. I have a breakdown almost everyday! Sometimes, I want to break up with him, but I can never go through with it because when I truly think about it, I do not want to. I just feel like I am stretching myself thin. Circling back to the porn I mentioned. He masturbates every morning before he leaves for work. His Reddit feed is mostly porn. he is into big proportions.

15675,"Because of my anxiety (and depression?) I live in constant fear and sadness. I am so afraid especially with everything related to my 2 year old son. I fear that I cannot control myself when he makes me angry, I will hurt him and traumatize him for life, just like I have been hurt and traumatized in the past by my own parents.I fear that when he accidentally hurts himself, I cannot help. When he was a baby, he almost choked on his food and I froze completely. Thankfully his mother did not freeze. That incident haunts me every day. It makes me so sad that my little boy had bad luck in life and he was born with me as his dad. He deserves better. My wife deserves better. I deserve better. Because of my anxiety I cannot even drive a car and every social contact scares me shitless. I do not have any friends and I try to avoid social contacts as much as I can, that includes all my relatives too. As a man I am a complete failure. I cannot fix anything, I am not socially competent, I am poor, uneducated, a bad father and a lousy husband. Complete and utter loser and a total failure. I am too coward to seek or ask any help and no one knows how I feel. Everyone thinks that I am just a cold-hearted asshole, but that is so far from the truth. It hurts me so much that I cannot show my loved ones how much I truly love them. Only times my life is somewhat tolerable is when I am alone, but I cannot be alone all the time because I have to work and take care of my family as best as I can. When I am alone at least I can cry freely. I feel completely exhausted all the time and no amount of sleep fixes that. My heart feels like it will come out of my chest, I feel like I am suffocating and I feel like that I am about to faint. My mind is dull, like I am in somekind of fog. I do not feel any joy, just sadness and apathy. I do not have energy to play with my son or treat my wife with the affection she deserves. Every time I am alone with my son I am so afraid that I almost cry, and when he is especially difficult I sometimes just cannot help myself and I openly cry and yell to him. I am such a piece of shit and he deserves better. I know that killing myself will hurt my loved ones, but I just do not care anymore. It will be better for them in the long run. I do not want to ruin my son's life anymore. His life will be better without a mentally unstable parent. My life would have been too.

19923,"Hi, first of all I want to apologize for any mistakes I make since english is not my first language. I just wanted to share my story dealing with depression and well just write down some random things I do that have been helping me out a lot lately. I am 23 years old and my depression has affected my life in so many ways that every time I look back on the things I lost because of it I cannot help but cry, I start having suicidal thoughts and then I just feel like the thought of not belonging anywhere and seeing how my mental state has affected me and my family (Especially my Mom) is slowly killing me. I have dropped out from three different Music colleges because I could not get myself to wake up every morning, I could not believe in myself enough. I found comfort in escaping life via Videogames, Anime, any form of digital media that could allow me to zone out and stop looking at my life. I found comfort in smoking, because killing myself slowly is a great way to deal with the pain. I do not know when and why all this started, I did not realize I had spent more than a year inside my bedroom barely moving, eating or talking to people, I do not know when I became aware that I was making my mother extremely worried and her live as a single parent extremely difficult. All I knew was that seeing that suffering made me want to move I have wasted 5 years of my life, of my familys life and I have nothing to show for it but an immense guilt that fills my chest with what can only be described as a thousand knifes. This is long and boring so Ill stop, point is a month ago I was finally able to start doing things to improve, things that help me wake up every morning and feel like I can try another day. If anyone out there finds this helpful in anyway, I hope this things can help you too. I started working out every day, as hard as it was to start it is as hard if not harder to look at who I was before I started. I started learning a language and I have been studying everyday. I started playing the piano and singing again everyday. I decided to start eating healthier, to go out for walks or just sit a cafe and listen to my favorite songs. I have been trying to cut down smoking, videogames, everything and just try to do it in healthier amounts. I am still unemployed but I am planning to go to school again starting September, this time I want to graduate and finally be able to help my mom. Just do the things you love, love your body, your mind and your soul. You are not alone and you will never be. Thank you, for reading this unnecessarily long thread. Hope this can be of use to somebody out there. Lots of love to all of you.

I then sleep until about 3 to 4 pm, and then the cycle continues. I have barely any money left and I am relying on selling some of my belongings in order to get money for my phone bills and food. I quit my last job due to the fact that I just did not have it in me to continue working in that environment: in an environment in which I felt like I was treated lower than everyone else working there. They did say that I was a good fit for the job, but I have a feeling they were lying, or they did not talk to the manager that oversaw my tasks at work, who I am pretty sure thought I was an idiot.. I am starting to believe him. At one point, it was functioning depression, but its not anymore. I eat poorly because of my depression: I eat way too much food: especially bad food. I went into town yesterday to get my meds, which only took about 2 hours. I came back and I was exhausted. It makes me think how I was even able to keep a job in the first place, if I cannot even go into town to get meds without being tired and fed up with life. The meds in question are anti-psychotics and anti depressants, since I hear voices and have delusions from time to time and have depression. Besides that, I have a hard time being a ""responsible"" adult. I put things off either because I am too scared of the outcome, or I just do not care enough to do it. I have been taking my meds on time and they helped for a while, but they do not help anymore. I just do not have the energy or the care to keep going with this life anymore.

24356,I am an almost 23 year old trans woman and I live in the South. I transitioned in my teens and have been mentally female as long as I can remember. Transitioning has been a blessing but also a curse. Gender dysphoria is the something I would not wish on my worst enemy. Before transitioning I simply would not label myself anything sexuality wise because being a gay male never felt true to me even though I was assigned male and am attracted to men. I always identified internally as a straight female. I graduated high school online. I tried public school but would stop going because of the bullying and harassment. When I finally transitioned I felt excited and happy but as the years went on the dysphoria got worst and I became more unhappy with myself. My parents divorced when I was 15. I still feel somehow responsible for it party. I always had problems and I always felt the strain it put on my family and parents. I cannot work because my anxiety is so bad I vomit and shake. I feel like every single person that looks at me or knows me is judging me. My two past relationships ended terribly. And I always blame myself and who I am for it. I truly feel unlovable. No matter how many surgeries or hormones I get I feel inadequate and inhuman. Nothing I can do elevates my sadness. I want to die peacefully and painlessly. that is what would make it better.

I am a young adult, definitely not a kid anymore, and I never had a childhood in a sense that I internalised my parents' helicoptering behaviour that avoided any type of slightly risky situations. I was the best of my class, a really nerdy kid (then the best of my group at college), never had friends in the neighborhood, never actually had just any friends. Never went out to play with anyone, never had any sleepover parties or anything. Being a kid sucked big time, my peers were always so loud and rude and cruel, while I was apparently cold and arrogant and always acted like a know-it-all and an ""adult"". I just wish I returned back and did everything differently. I hate myself for being how I am and for not having any experiences or memories apart from sitting in front of the PC days long. Mom worked, dad left, so no-one could really tell anything was wrong apparently.I was always so focused on imaginary success that I was obsessively trying to be the best in the class (not to gain any actual knowledge, important distinction). Now being an adult, I am expected to get a job by my parents, while all I can do is sit on a couch all day remembering every small bad thing that has happened over the course of my life. I have lost all enthusiasm for working hard and being successful just at the moment I am actually expected to become like that. I wish it all ended, but I know I am too cowardly to take my life, I had an attempt before, basically barely scratched my arms, now my mom blames me for ""doing that to her"" and she complained about having arythmia when she accidentally learned that I did it again recently. So I cannot even let it out like that. I wake up and go to bed thinking about it all, and I do not see any solutions. I do not even know if I am just making everything up bc of not wanting to work and to grow up, I was not horribly abused, neglected or whatever, idk.

I know I can do well academically when my mental issues are not crippling me but at this point to make it into some sort of further education, do well there and find work seems like an almost impossible slog that will take me my entire 30s at best, at worst a risky gamble that might not result in work anyway.

When I try to get help from those closest to me, I end up feeling obligated to way underplay the situation, because I ""do not want them to feel like they have to shoulder the burden."" I do this for a reason I will explain later.I hate online mental health initiatives. Whenever depression and suicide is brought up, they always share that same number. That same fucking number. Like they are saying ""yeah, do not talk to me. talk to someone who gets paid to tell you not to off yourself using a generic script.""I cannot even blame them. I tried to help someone who clearly was suicidal before, and I could not. I was too weak. I tried shouldering their burdens until I got crushed. So now I live with the belief that I will do that to anyone I reach out to. And if I cannot shoulder someone else's pain, I do not deserve to have someone else to shoulder mine. I could talk to my parents. And get the same canned response every time. As fundamentalists, they firmly believe that my depression is caused by some sort of sin in my life. Even if they are right, just pointing that out is not helping, it just makes me feel worse. ""You did this to yourself. If you just had more Jesus in your life you would not be in this place."" Gee. Thanks.So, we are back to suicide hotlines. People who are paid to read a script, and tell you exactly what you want to hear. If I were not such a cynical asshole, maybe that would help. If I could suspend my disbelief for one second, maybe it would actually mean something to me. As is, though, I just feel awkward, and I try to end the call as soon as possible. And therapy? I do not have money. And my parents do not believe in that. And because of the kind of person I am I literally cannot reach out for financial assistance. And on and on it goes. Excuses, excuses, excuses. If and when I die an early death, it will be entirely my fault. Because I cannot and will not change who I am. Here we are, then. Reaching out to an online forum.

I am very hypersensitive person. While I avoid people because I have had horrible experience with people and prefer to be alone. I cannot emotionally connect to people. She said ""The problem lies in my thoughts. External forces are not majorly responsible for your anxiety"" Some of the opinions is hard to digest. I can understand from her POV.

Explaining using that Disney movie Inside Out as a metaphor.I do not cut myself for attention the last thing I want is attention. I am shrouded in self hatred so why would I want other people to pile onto that. I cut myself to feel control, to feel like I have a choice in the narrative that I am experiencing. it is the only way I know how.It would be like if the 5 main characters of the movie were living their life but there was also a secret 6th character, repression. He got thrown into that forgotten memories pit but he clawed his way back out holding a grudge. He broke into central control and is holding the other emotions hostage. They are forced to watch him ruin the life they made and cannot do anything about it. They have no control and can only watch what unfolds. They can give suggestions, like go to bed on time or exercise, but he will not take that advice. So finally, to feel some sense of control in this hell, they suggest something he will like.

35852,"Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? I’m and 18F student and ever since coming to college I’ve had very bad health anxiety, where as soon as any small thing is wrong I’m online 8-10 hours a day trying to diagnose.
My most recent issue is a rash I’ve had on my forearms, wrists, and back of my hands for the past few days. It’s very itchy, mostly at night, and when I scratch I get hive-like spots that sometimes stay, and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and don’t show up well in pictures. I’ve been applying hydrocortisone 1% since Saturday night and it’s still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. 
After looking online I’ve narrowed it down to hives, eczema, scabies, or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching, and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also, I’ve been feeling itchy around my ears, scalp, and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.
Overall I don’t really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I can’t talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious.

We met a few months ago, everything was fine, he was funny, charming, very kind and compassionate, always motivated me and believed in my goals. He was madly in love with me and at some point I finally said ""I love you"" back and he was the happiest human being ever. We had so much fun watching movies, playing video games, listening to music and being loving and caring for each other. Talking for hours at night. At some point I felt like he was drifting away. He always had depressiv problems like he is not good enough for me, I should find someone better. Also all his former girlfriends left him for someone better. I thought okay, maybe he is hurt because of that. But yeah, he drifted away, no more kind words anymore and at some point he could not say ""I love you"" anymore. He often apologized and said he felt bad because he thinks it hurts me. He stopped texting me, he withdrawed, all I get are one word answers, I cannot really get through to him. If I ask if he wants to stay in a relationship with me he just says ""I do not know"". Its always ""I do not know."" He mentioned pretty often that he wants to die, that its decided and I cannot do anything about it. Shortly after he can do jokes again, as if he never said something hurting to me. While I am fighting back tears, he changes the topic to something fun like nothing happened. Everything escalated when he acted in a worrying way, called me and told me to let him go, he has to leave and texting me beforehand that he does not want to be here anymore. I knew he was very angry and impulsive (he also has ADHD) and I feared for his life. I called the emergency and they send over the police. I had a panic attack and acted in a desperate way. After that I got the most angry call I ever got, I was yelled at what in the hell I was thinking, he was not at risk and now his whole family knows. He said he cannot trust me anymore. After that he still reached out to me, wanted to talk but after I asked, ""talk about what?"" he responded again ""nothing"" I do not know what to do anymore, he always said he refuses any help, I begged him to maybe even consider seeking professional help. I just want to understand what he is going through. Apparently he cannot really communicate with me. I have to ask for even the slightest thing and if I ask too much its exhausting for him. I have to say I am kind of glad his family finally knows, even if I get the anger now, its okay, I take it, I was just really worried for his life. Everyone in my family says I should stay away but nobody knows how he was before. I was doubting myself, he is all charming and happy around anyone else but I get pushed away, to me he cannot talk anymore and now he is also angry at me. Like I said, I can take it, I just want him to get better.Maybe you can help me to understand him better. He told me he lost all feelings, he is at a dark place but he still reaches out to me, after all. Every day. I have to say I distanced myself a little, I spent the last weeks crying, thinking of him every day, what he is going through. Being there for him, putting myself back. But I cannot do that anymore if he refuses professional help, that will not help him and I get destroyed. He also always mentioned I should leave, I would just get hurt. He does not want me to be around anymore, even though it was his biggest wish that I would visit. He says he is not the same guy anymore and he failed me. I constantly get pushed away. Everyone else gets treated like always. And I am just the trash can for everything it seems. I am just ""there"". He cannot even talk to me anymore. &amp;#x200B;I do not recognize my boyfriend anymore, I was thinking if he got bored of me, lost interest and just cannot break up. I told him several times, just break up with me and be honest if you are not happy with the relationship. Sometimes its ""I do not want to break up."" and the other times its always ""Idk"".&amp;#x200B;Maybe you can suggest something or help me understand him more. Because somehow he cannot put into words what he is going through. Am I the reason here? Did I do something wrong? Should I leave him be? The only time he really talked to me was when he was angry as hell and called me stuff nobody else every called me. It was very hurtful. He does not understand my point of view, everything I did was wrong. And I do not have the right to be mad at him. When I try to talk about it its always ""I need to go now."" ""I hope you have an amazing life."" Like ?? I do not understand and I am not here so someone can play with my feelings every day. Even if he does not do it on purpose. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how to get through to him, he seems to be at a place where I just cannot follow... Please help.

21286,"I feel sick for days on end because I do not eat enough and all I can do is lay in bed and listen to my stomach and smell the dirty dishes in the sink and think about how I have not washed my hair in days and feel more and more sick until I just go back to sleep to shut it all out. I do not feel sad, I just feel sick and exhausted and disinterested. I used to do so much like art and guitar and hikes when I was a teenager but now my interests just sit across the room from me collecting dust. On days I work I manage to get more done unless I just end up going to bed around 7pm when I get home. But usually I will have random bursts of motivation which will allow me to do cleaning and some hygienic things. it is so embarrassing because when my boyfriend gets home he just sees me laying in bed still at 5 or 6pm and he has to go do things and I have spent the day thinking maybe I will be able to drag myself out of bed if we can just go out and do something. But of course he is usually busy and even when we go do things I always come back here and feel like I just want to sleep. He helps do chores when I do not do them but I cannot expect him to pick it all up for me. And I am sitting here thinking I need to get my shit together. How can he be attracted to someone like this. How can I show up at my parent's house looking great and convincing them my life is going so well, just to go home and lay in bed again, and think about how my body is only going to deteriorate more the longer I lay here. I know I will not get my shit together though. it is weird to have people call you admirable and capable just because you have a half decent job or a degree but inside you do not feel like really anything half memorable or interesting. Just because I can read into what people are saying, or like to learn a lot, does not really mean I am any different from anyone else, and at the end of my life my interests will not actually mean anything or make a difference, because we kind of just live and then die, and that is it. I have health conditions that also make functioning just hard for me, POTS and structural issues. Makes it hard to walk around sometimes, to just get up, to stay active and feel full of energy. And I do not think my emotions are too related to that, it just combines into a larger hurdle for me to overcome.I dunno. I do not feel a lot. it is the fact that I do not feel a lot, and when I do I sob like a child and my heart feels like it is about to explode, and then I go back into this numb, hungry sleep until the next time I am alive enough to feel pain again. This is rambly and borders on nonsensical but I am just saying what I am thinking. I certainly talk to some people in my life about my feelings but all that is done is made me realize I sound like a broken record, and after a point they do not need to ask why I am crying or why I bailed on all of the plans, because they have heard it about a million times.

22897,"Hello,&amp;#x200B;I want to write a bit about myself and share it here. I am terribly depressed. A few months ago I tried to kill myself but failed to find the courage to make it happen. I had a few ups and downs in terms of my depression since then. Right now, I am in a very low spot. One of the things I think about a lot, is that no one really knows much about me, the life I have lived, or even how I feel. So... I wanted to share with you all here and I am hoping it helps me. This may be long winded. I expect it will get removed or downvoted. If you decide to read it, thanks for taking a bit of your time to read about my tiny, worthless life.&amp;#x200B;My name is Tay\_tay86. I am a transgender woman. I was born male and cursed with being trans. there is nothing I can do about it. it is just who I am. I have had the unfortunate luck to have a right wing loving, bible thumping family. I was homeschooled all of my life with a Christian bible based education. Something that has done me no favors at all. My parents dislike me. My Dad has not spoken more than a few sentences to me in a few years. My Mom is an alcoholic and zealous about her faith and political beliefs. So we fight. A lot. And I have been told repeatedly how upset ""the entire family is at tay\_tay86"". My older brother barely speaks to me. Until about two weeks ago I had not seen him in 12 years. He does not answer my texts. I can never get a hold of him. He... just does not love me or care about me. Even if we did grow up together. Most of my friends from growing up, college, and graduate school are all either dead or have moved on with their lives. Most ghosted me. No matter how hard I tried in college and graduate school I never formed good friendships. In graduate school, most of my class mates even openly disdained me. One took my scholarship from me. Another my desk in the TA lounge. Another my internship. The one time I got to go out with them to have drinks, we all drank until drunk. But they left me when I got sick to fend for myself. Being left to fend for myself is something that happens a lot to me. Even though I try so hard to be the kind of friend that I would want to others, it just happens over and over. I take care of people's dogs when they are on trips. I send christmas gifts and birthday cards. I attend all the events I can, but I am never considered a friend in their eyes. I am just... usable. And when someone is done using me, they discard me.Funny. That kind of behavior is probably what led me into getting abused. My ex, now a few years ago, regularly screamed at me. She called me a dumb, deaf, and blind bitch. I cried in McDonalds bathrooms. I got pushed around in bars in front of 'friends' by her (Who did nothing but act like I did not exist as I got abused).She even threatened to get my dog killed. To let him out the back gate of our house when I was gone at work. So he could run into the road and get hit by a car. All because he licks his lips loudly. And when we broke up, I of course gave her almost everything I could. Anything to make up for the absolutely shitty kind of person I am. I cannot count the number of times I begged for forgiveness. Forgiveness for leaving hot cocoa powder out on the counter (in a can). Or Scizzors left out. Or for trying to help her set up some speakers.I actually had to go to a women's shelter for help. Sucked. I do not really know what else to say. That was a horrible time in my life.Then there was the time I almost got pulverized with a rock in a cave by 2 men in front of my sister. All I did was ask them to stop doing graffiti... and they turned on me when they heard what my voice sounded like. Sucks.Through the pandemic I did my best to check in on people, but no one bothered to check in on me or how I was doing. No one really cared if I got sick or died I believe. I work in healthcare and our getting sick was a massive concern. And now people are just nasty about things like masks. And now it is 2021... Things should go better right? I tried to kill myself just a few months into it. I am just about broke. People hate me. No one talks to me. Even if I am with someone, no one ever tries to talk to me about anything. I cannot even get in small talk because people re-direct their attention so fast to whoever I am with. My body aches from the damage my ex did to me. Something that has lingered for years now. I do not think I will ever physically or emotionally heal from her now. Ah, and reddit... I made a comment on a thread. Expressing disagreement with someone. And a day later I get tagged in a post dedicated to ridiculing, invalidating, and denigrating me. People are just so intent on hating me. Destroying me. I do not know what to do or what I have even done except try to exist. My inbox is full of ways to kill myself.I feel absolutely hopeless. I do not even want to wake up anymore. People keep saying things will get better, but it does not. It just piles on to what was already there. I am not strong. I am weak. Even if I try to play a video game or something to relax I get harassed for being trans. I get told to kill myself every single day.

8306,"I have been working from home since the pandemic began and still live with parents.Since then I have hardly left the house or seen friends and feel like both my mental and physical health have been impacted tremendously. I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point.

13441,"I am edging closer and closer to killing myself. I have never ever thought that I would actually do it, but lately I am starting to doubt that conviction. I am almost 40 and things are not getting better. I live with my parents again for the umpteenth time in my life after breaking up for the umpteenth time with the woman I have been with for umpteen years and losing the umpteenth job because of what I call mental health issues but most other people call laziness. I am 30 thousand dollars in debt in student loans, the schooling for which has never helped me get a single job. I have never made much more than minimum wage and I have never even put a dent in paying off the loans. What a waste of time and money school was.I have violent thoughts towards myself all the time and often I find myself thinking about violence against faceless entities like ""the government"" or ""the rich"". I have sought mental health help for many, many years in many, many forms and there is nothing that seems to help me cope with my lack of success. I am on pills now and they make me feel less angry but not less sad. I am really thinking that I may not be able to hold my resolve against my growing instinct that I would be better off just ending things.What should I do? (Going to the hospital never yields results, I have done that a number of times and quite frankly I do not need to be put on a 48 hour watch, I am not crazy, I am at the end of my rope -- I have no more fucks to give). I was going to tell my parents or my ex how I was feeling but I just keep stopping myself because I do not feel like putting the burden on them. So I searched 'suicide' on reddit and here I am.

19253,"For the longest time I have been very very depressed. my Depression started when I was probably in elementary school. I was sent to the counselor's office because I looked sad or I was acting sad or I was not participating in class because I was so overwhelmed with my emotions. My father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. My mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003. She sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that I was gay. She also kicked me out of the house at 17. I ended up leasing a cheap SRO studio in Chicago so I could have a roof over my head. I paid for that rent with my job at Best Buy. I still do not know how I did it, but I didFast forward to 2015. I went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 I started doing heroin occasionally\[and now I do it almost every day -- its been like this since September 2020\]Despite all of this, I was still dating because I thought that finding a partner would fix everything.I met the person who I thought would be my partner for life in 2018. Even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year I still kept coming back. I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end. Ill never see these people again, right?I am quite sure that I am going to be done with all of this by the end of July. I cannot take life anymore. Humans are horrible.tl;dr: I am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. I am also an addict.

26886,"hey people,I really need to talk to someone about this because i really do not know myself anymore. Am i in deppresion?&amp;#x200B;Here is the thing, i have been feeling like this for a few months now. i am an hisghschool student and this is my last year so i will be heading to university next year. And i am the ambitious type so I have been and will keep working real hard for getting accepted to a good university and it will consume a lot of my time but the truth is, if i do not have anything to i start thinking and it is not really fun for me because when i think, i just feel alone. I feel really alone. I have some frinds. You can even say i have a lot of friends. I have really close friend too that listen to me when i am sad of talking about a problem. The thing is tho it just does not work. I have not really talked to this in lenght to anyone but when i kind of open the coversation, i just feel that they just will not understand and stop talking. Change the topic. I feel that they just will not understand. They cannot. they are out there living their life, having fun, flirting or meeting new people and i feel like I am just the figurant in these stories. I do not feel like the protagonist of my own life anymore. I just feel like a figurant when i am with people and i just feel awfully alone when i am by myself. I used to like being to myself and listening to music. It just bores me anymore. I get bored when i am with people too. It just feels like everyone is living their lives to the fullest and i am watching on the sidelines. I feel alone. Really alone.I used to have a lover a few months back but i broke up with her. Not because something she did. I just could not see her that often anymore and i did not really love her anymore as well.She was my first and i was hers but after we did it for the first time, she told me that she did'nt want to do it for some time. That really hurt me. I know because she is a women she has a larger say in this but that was very hurtful and our relationship was not the same after that night. I broke up with her around one months later. I never regretted my decision to breakup with her but i have been feeling really alone since then. I do not really have suicidal thoughts of anything. I mean to be honest i sometimes think bout suicide but i do it just briefly and i do not take it seriously. it has been kind of happening on an increasing rate laltey though. still i do not do it that often i do not think that is problem for now.I like alcohol. not too much i am not an alcoholic. But i like how when i am drunk, my problems disappear. Its like i levae my problems for the future me. The problem is, I have not been enjoying alcohol lately as well. When i drink, i just get sad and listen to music in some corner now. isolate myself. i drink kind of alot lately as well. Not everyday of anthing but it has been increasing.I feel like i am not an important person for anyone except my family and they know only the side i show them and i know only the side they show me. I do not think people are genuine when they talk to me about their general feelings. I just do not trust people truly. I just think that they are screenig a play, a facade. You might say that i feel alone jst because i do not have a love interest but it is not like that. I am not a playboy or anything so i did not have a lover for most of my life. The relation i talked about was the longest it was two months. The problem is tho, i never really felt this way, this alone. I really did not feel like this before and it really discomfots me.When i do not have a task that i have to to, i just do not want to do anyrhing anymore. i do not want to sleep but i do not want stay awake too because i know the day doesn;t have anyrhing more to give me. I know my problem is as serious as most people that are truly in clinical depression but i need to know. what do i do how do i get on with my lonely life. I have hobbies i play the guitar, i really like history and videogames. Watchin moves too but i have not been enjoying them as much lately. I just do not feel like i have the time for 2 hour movies, I do not enjoy videogames anymore and they just bore me after 1 hour. I used to play the guitar for hours before once I have started, noe i just play 1-2 songs and quit. what is this feeling i feel like i cannot breath freely like there is a weight above me.I thought it was stress but now i am in summer holiday and nothing has changed. There was not that serious of a school because of covid anyways. is it loneliness?

24305,"Hey all, I have been diagnosed with depression for over 5 years now after a suicide attempt I made when I was just 13. I also struggle with anxiety and DPDR. I am just making this post to write down some of my feelings about depression. /// do not fall in love with your depression. Depression does not give you anything. It does not give you empathy, or a cool aesthetic, or teach you anything. Depression only takes from you. It takes up your time and energy, leaving you feeling tired and defeated day after day. Depression is not your friend, its more akin to a cancer that is stuck on your body that is slowly killing you each day. I know its easy to fall in love with depression. After all, proximity creates love. Its convenient. With so many people coming and going from our life, its easy to assume that something is worth loving if it sticks around long enough. But do not fall in love with what hurts you. do not even become friends with it. When you pass by it on the street, do not even look it in the eye. do not fall in love with what kills you every day. do not fall in love with your depression",Depression,hey diagnosed depression years suicide attempt made also struggle anxiety dpdr making post write feelings depression fall love depression depression give anything give empathy cool aesthetic teach anything depression takes takes time energy leaving feeling tired defeated day day depression friend akin cancer stuck body slowly killing day know easy fall love depression proximity creates love convenient many people coming going life easy assume something worth loving sticks around long enough fall love hurts even become friends pass street even look eye fall love kills every day fall love depression,ဟေ့ဟူသောစိတ်ကျရောဂါဝေဒနာများကိုသတ်သေရန်ကြိုးပမ်းမှုသည်စိတ်ကျဝေဒနာကိုခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ နေ့တိုင်းသေဆုံး

I had gotten sick twice with flu like symptoms during the brief few months we hooked up. I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine. Fast forward to two weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node but didn’t feel sick. Ignored it. I woke up this morning to a rash on my breast and I don’t know where it came from. It doesn’t hurt or itch it’s just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldn’t feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesn’t go away. I had just gotten another general health panel done on my blood a month ago and was told I was completely healthy. Well after doing research I found out that general health panels don’t screen for HIV. So now I’m freaking out. I had the lymphnode, and now the rash and I think I have tongue thrush. Not severe or anything but my tongue definitely looks whiter than usual. I’m going to get tested this week but I’m so fucking scared.

17100,"Hi. Thanks for reading this. I am 21F. I just failed my first year of college because I missed too many assignments. It was the result of a mixture of things including learning being entirely online and my lack of motivation. I had a meeting with an advisor who asked me flat out, ""is this the right life path for you right now?"" to which I replied, ""I do not know but I do not have a choice either way."" To explain, before I came to university halls I lived with my parents in a one bedroom apartment. I slept in their living room for a year after I had to drop out of college the first time. This is my second stab at it. I know they say third time's the charm but this is getting ridiculous now. I dropped out the first time for mental health issues. I have failed this year for the same reason. I knew I probably was not ready for university yet, but all I could think about was getting out of my parents' house. It was the easiest route to take in order for that to happen. My mother's a hoarder, and both of my parents are emotionally unavailable and have a history of being abusive.Living alone, I fair much, much better mentally but still not at a functioning level. If I am dysfunctional living alone, then living with my parents I am actively suicidal. I have attempted before under their roof. I could not even tell them about it. I called the ambulance myself and left in it without them even waking up. I have had friends' parents pick me up off of overpasses and asking me ""why are not your parents out looking for you?""The thing is the dream of getting away from abuse is not all rosy. Once you are away from it, you need to know how to function and I cannot do that. I do not think I am good enough at anything to do a degree in anything. I have tried three different fields. I hate myself to my absolute core. I hate my apathy regarding my life and everything around me. I hate my laziness and my seemingly inability to just be a responsible adult. I feel like a child. I do not feel like I ever had the opportunity to be a kid in my abusive household and now I have to fend for myself like I have been doing my whole life. I am tired. I just want it to stop. My situation rn is dire. My bank balance is in the negatives and by the end of the month I will have nowhere to live. I have applied for jobs and am hoping to hear back. Financial benefits even if I did qualify for them will not even cover the rent in the area where I live. I do not know what to do. It is looking likely I will have to move back home temporarily for two months (and know full well I will be actively suicidal for that time) and then try to repeat the year.My advisor is worried this is not the right life path for me, but I do not have the money to live alone right now outside of studying. I am relying heavily on my student loan which will be paid in September to get me by. I am an idiot so do not have savings. I have been disassociated for days and just feel trapped. I wish I was just good enough to do this degree and be responsible. I wish I could take care of myself. I am a bad person and I have hurt so many people so I do not even have any friends right now besides my best friend. I deserve to die. I have nothing to live for. There is not hope. I wish I could just have help and I guess for most people that comes from their parents but I just cannot. I do not have that. I am 21 and need to fend for myself and I cannot even do that properly.I do not know what I enjoy or what I am good at which makes making any decision impossible. it is why school was great for me. I got told what to do. Ever since I left, I have had absolutely no clue what to do with my life. I know it sounds stupid but it is so scary being an adult and I do not know how to do it. I turned 21 just this month and I do not feel any older than 17. I am not sure how to move forward. I do not expect anyone to know either. I guess I am just looking for support. I do not know how I can go on.Thanks for reading. 21F college student at a loss of how to move forward",Suicidal,hi thanks reading f failed first year college missed many assignments result mixture things including learning entirely online lack motivation meeting advisor asked flat right life path right replied know choice either way explain came university halls lived parents one bedroom apartment slept living room year drop college first time second stab know say third time charm getting ridiculous dropped first time mental health issues failed year reason knew probably ready university yet could think getting parents house easiest route take order happen mother hoarder parents emotionally unavailable history abusive living alone fair much much better mentally still functioning level dysfunctional living alone living parents actively suicidal attempted roof could even tell called ambulance left without even waking friends parents pick overpasses asking parents looking thing dream getting away abuse rosy away need know function cannot think good enough anything degree anything tried three different fields hate absolute core hate apathy regarding life everything around hate laziness seemingly inability responsible adult feel like child feel like ever opportunity kid abusive household fend like whole life tired want stop situation rn dire bank balance negatives end month nowhere live applied jobs hoping hear back financial benefits even qualify even cover rent area live know looking likely move back home temporarily two months know full well actively suicidal time try repeat year advisor worried right life path money live alone right outside studying relying heavily student loan paid september get idiot savings disassociated days feel trapped wish good enough degree responsible wish could take care bad person hurt many people even friends right besides best friend deserve die nothing live hope wish could help guess people comes parents cannot need fend cannot even properly know enjoy good makes making decision impossible school great got told ever since left absolutely clue life know sounds stupid scary adult know turned month feel older sure move forward expect anyone know either guess looking support know go thanks reading f college student loss move forward,မင်္ဂလာပါ။ Fair Night College ကတာ 0 န်တွေကနေလေ့လာမှုအတွက်လေ့လာမှုတစ်ခုမှာစာသင်ခန်းတက္ကသိုလ်တစ်ခွက်လောက်ရှိတဲ့တက္ကသိုလ်ခန်းမတစ်ခေါက်မှာစာသင်ခန်းတက္ကသိုလ်တစ်ခွက်ကျနေပြီဆိုတဲ့စာသင်ခန်းတက္ကသိုလ်တစ်လျှောက်လုံးမှာစာသင်ခန်းတက္ကသိုလ်တစ်ခွက်ကျနေပြီဆိုတာကိုသိတာပေါ့။ ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သောစိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာအရအလုပ်ရှုပ်နေသည့်နေရာများတွင်နေထိုင်သောအိမ်တွင်း၌နေထိုင်သောအင်းစီးသမားများနေထိုင်သောအိမ်ရှင်မပြောရရင်မိဘတွေရဲ့ဘဝကိုမထီမဲ့မြင်ပြုခြင်းကိုမုန်းတီးနေတာကိုကြည့်ရတာမကောင်းဘူးလို့မထင်မှတ်ဘဲနေတဲ့အရာတွေအားလုံးကိုမုန်းတီးနေတဲ့အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုမုန်းတီးနေတဲ့အရာကဘာကိုမဆိုမုန်းတယ်။ အခြေအနေ RN Dire Bankance Negatives End Mount Remones Remonly Reading area area ရိယာတွင်နေထိုင်သောအ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်နေထိုင်ခြင်းကိုသာလူသိများသည့်အ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်နေထိုင်မှုကိုသေချာစွာနေထိုင်ရန်အပြည့်အဝမရရှိနိုင်သည့်အနေဖြင့်ပြန်လည်ပတ်မှုအပြည့်အ 0 ရရှိသောအ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်များ၌နေထိုင်သောအစဉ်အလာကိုအပြည့်အဝမ 0 င်ပါကကောင်းသောလက်ျာဘက်သို့သွားသောလူအများစုကနေ 0 တ်ထုများအပြည့်အဝနေထိုင်ခြင်းကိုပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်စွာနေထိုင်ရန်ကြိုးစားခြင်းကိုပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်စွာနေထိုင်ရန်အတွက်ကောင်းမွန်သောဘဝလမ်းစဉ်တွင်ကောင်းမွန်စွာနေထိုင်ရန်အတွက်ကောင်းမွန်သောဘဝလမ်းစဉ်ကိုသေချာစွာနေထိုင်ရန်ကြိုးစားပါ အသက်မွေး 0 မ်းကျောင်းမှုအရကောင်းကျိုးများကိုသိရှိနိုင်ရန်အပြည့်အ 0 သိရှိနိုင်ရန်အပြည့်အ 0 သိရှိနိုင်ရန်အပြင်းအထန်ပြောနိုင်သည်မှာသေချာသည်

17598,"Idk who goes through what in their lives but just tell me if you have ever felt this, the way i did cuzz i just want to know people are facing the same shit as me or am i really the 1 in a million as my doctor said once to me. I had the worst night in my life and what happened today it happen before too but it was like rarely so for me this was not a big of a deal. I always keep my phone far away from me when i sleep like above me and when i need something in the night usually i do not but in case i do then sometimes my hand would reach out to the phone and sometimes it will not reach, or sometimes i would just yell and someone would come. Last night i got in a very uncomfortable position while sleeping and normally i would come back to my sleeping position but idk why i could not move myself forward it is not just my legs it is my whole body that does not work and I have been in this place before, i remember when i could raise my hand and one day i could not, there was a time when i used to walk and then i could not even stand, or when my internal organs started failing. Okay so what is next now? My voice i guess cuzz in the end vocal cords are also muscles and I have this disease Muscular Dystrophy so my every muscle in my body is going to die so i will not be able to speak in some years well that is too bad cuzz everybody says I am very talkative. Sometimes I have the strength and sometimes I am a person who cannot even move a little by herself. So I am like yah whatever let us just call someone to help me out so i tried to get my phone but i guess it was my lucky day my hand could not reach to the phone then i tried shouting no one could hear me they were all in their room sleeping. I was not able to sleep leave that part what is the worst was, cuzz of the uncomfortable position in which I was my leg started to pain so badly and all i wanted was to get out of this pain i shouted for like 2 hours straight still no one could hear me that moment i cannot even explain how i felt... how weak, how hopeless these words are not even enough for me honestly it straight up felt like a cruel torture like i was in a hell and i kept wondering why is this happening to me? What did i do? WHY ? why someone would put me in this miserable life, in this almost dead body who does not have any strength to even move a little, is this you call living? No i think for me the living is dead.After 2 hours my mom woke up and she said from now on keep your phone close to you while sleeping. In my head i was like yah i will keep my phone close to me from now on but what about the fact that I am dead? Or maybe i died again in those 2 hours and maybe I will die like this someday again!. Whoever sees me may call this life of mine living but if you are not sitting in my wheelchair then i do not think you know how i feel. I will try to explain you how it feels like to sit in my wheelchair... I was very little when me and my family got to know that I have this disease called muscular dystrophy and there is no cure for it in the whole world even Stefan Hawkins had this disease not the exact one as mine cuzz this disease I have, it has many types but they are all quite similar. I was born with this disease but it can come to its real form in any age of your life in your 20s or in your childhood nobody knows so you see I was a normal kid back then I used to go to school I had this many friends and I was also the prettiest among everywhere I go and now it is all gone my beauty, my friends, my normal life idk what is left in me now. It has been 9 years since I have been bedridden. My brain, heart, lungs, my facial features and my senses, back bone, fingers, voice, and a little bit of hand movements these all things which I have mentioned only these things work for now other than anything in my body which I did not mention is dead, like for example my legs and my digestive system. I am very thin, the kind of thin that I bet you have never seen before cuzz of loss of muscle in my body, my coller bones are unusually deep, it is like my bones are super visible and when I say I look like an alien I mean it. You know I can keep on writing about my problems cuzz there are so many and believe me these are all the minor ones i have not even started talking about the bigger ones I just do not know what to do with this life it is like there is no control no certainty about my life or neither of my death I am just stuck in a middle of nowhere where I just wake up everyday to have 10 kinds of different pain in my body and despite having them I have to live as a happy person cuzz nobody likes a person who is depress all the time.

16819,"there is a old arabic saying that goes like this: ""You want to kill yourself? Throw yourself into the sea and watch yourself fight for survival. You do not want to kill yourself, you want to kill something within you.""I have been suicidal and depressed on the latter part of my teenage years. Even now i feel depressed from time to time, we all do i think. But i want to flip the common thought of depression on its head, just to look at it from another perspective. I am not denying that suicidal thoughts and depression has neurological base but I am not going to talk about brain structure and all that stuff. I think you can deal with depression here and now.People who are depressed and want to commit suicide are the ones that might love life too much. The universe is flowing through them at the speed so fast that they cannot handle. They are too full of ocean of life and have too much feels. What they really are seeking for when they want to commit suicide is to return home, to the source, to rejoice with the vast ocean that is life. They very much want to live and they want to live authentically.What they really want to kill is the ego, which fabricates the story of their life which they now realize is bizarrely illusionary. The idea one has to end ones life is actually a point of awakening. They want to wake up and they want to reach the bridge of life and get to the otherside, which could also mean death. Death feels very certain and very real. Life on the otherhand intangible and uncertain, it is always moving.I think this is why many people have had experiences of awakening right after coming out of the darkest hours. Now when i feel sadness and negative emotions, i look them as an opportunity and an invitation to change the current narrative of my life that is not working out for me, or to delete it completely.I try to face my emotions head on, rather than suppress them, by metitation. I sit, eyes closed, hold my thoughts and emotions like a baby. Bathe yourself in your emotions. Listen to them. Listen to the underlying intelligence beneath the sadness because it is there for a reason. it is there to try to communicate something. It has to be heard. do not fight it.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

I've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which I understand).

I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

It did not help that soon after my parents got divorced my mom made us move into her boyfriends house right away (I still see my dad often). To this day I cannot say I am fully okay. But my little sister was not really bothered by the divorce. In fact she loved my moms new boyfriend and I was mad at her for it. I cannot explain why and that is not really the point of this post anyways. Sometime into my sophomore year things got really bad between my mom and her boyfriend. They started hitting each other, breaking things, and often times my moms boyfriend would storm out of the house leaving my little brother and sister to go and comfort my mom. My sister even slept with my mom sometimes. Things got so bad my mom and her bf from up and we moved houses and this is where my sister began to not be okay. My mom and her bf spend a couple months apart but it did not take long for them to get back together. We moved back in with her bf at the end of my junior year and now I am a senior. I noticed that something was right with my sister so I sat down with her in her room to talk. She bursted out crying when I asked her if she just wanted her big sister back to talk to her. Our relationship is slowly building up and we are slowly getting back to where we were. But today while I was doing my sisters hair I noticed she would not look at herself in the mirror when I asked her to put her head up she looked straight at the ceiling. Later while I was doing her hair still she began crying and she still will not tell me what is wrong. I am begging my mom to take my sister to therapy but she is a piece of garbage and at this point I might as well be the mom of my siblings. Please help me idk what to do. My little sister is depressed and I do not know what to do",Depression,little sister years old younger two peas pod love anything relationship took turn worst freshmen yearly high school year parents gotten divorced really took toll mentally help soon parents got divorced mom made us move boyfriends house right away still see dad often day cannot say fully okay little sister really bothered divorce fact loved moms new boyfriend mad cannot explain really point post anyways sometime sophomore year things got really bad mom boyfriend started hitting breaking things often times moms boyfriend would storm house leaving little brother sister go comfort mom sister even slept mom sometimes things got bad mom bf moved houses sister began okay mom bf spend couple months apart take long get back together moved back bf end junior year senior noticed something right sister sat room talk bursted crying asked wanted big sister back talk relationship slowly building slowly getting back today sisters hair noticed would look mirror asked put head looked straight ceiling later hair still began crying still tell wrong begging mom take sister therapy piece garbage point might well mom siblings please help idk little sister depressed know,ညီမလေးလေးငယ်လေးနှစ်ယောက်အချစ်သူနှစ်ယောက်သည်အသည်းအသန်ကွာရှင်းပြတ်စဲမှုကအသည်းအသန်အသည်းအသန်မပြောတတ်သေးသောမိခင်ဖြစ်သူကအသည်းအသန်အယုံအကြည်မပြောနိုင်တော့သည့်အမေသည်အလွန်စိတ်အနှောင့်အယှက်မပြောနိုင်တော့ဘဲအလွန်အမင်းအသည်းအသန်မပြောနိုင်ပါ။ Mom Mommune Mom Mome House What Mom Mom Read Hearning The Mome Hour Hearning Hearing Mom Mome Hearning Hearning Mom Mome Hearning Hearning Hearning Mom Mom Mome Heart The Mome Heart Mome Heart Mom Mom Rearing Mome Hearning Mom Mome Heart Mom Mom Reply Mom Mome Mom Mome Mom Mome Mom Mome Mom Mome Mome Mom Mome Mom Mome Mome Mome Mom idk စိတ်ကျရောဂါစိတ်ကျရောဂါ

I have been in a relationship for 3 years now and we have been living together for one year. And I thought I was happy but I have looked back on my life recently and its filled with so many regretsWhen I was 18 my family and I got kicked out of our house because the person we were renting off decided to sell it, leaving us homeless. My mum and dad were able to stay at my sisters house and I was able to stay at my girlfriends. We thought we had it sorted in 3 weeks but it turned into 6 months before we got a house. The whole time I was working in a bar doing long, late shifts and I was not sleeping properly and constantly being sick because of it.We got a house sorted and three months later covid hit. I was put on furlough for three months before opening again. Just before I went back to work, myself and my girlfriend got our own place to live together. But things were not good whenever I went back to work She worked most mornings and I was always on the evening shifts so we never really got to see each other. I came home to her crying so many times and it was making me depressed because I felt so bad leaving her all the time . I then decided to find a new job to keep her happy and now I am in a job I do not like but i was able to finish at 5 so it made her happyA year has now passed and I feel like I am trapped. I feel like I have spent the last 3 years doing stuff to make her happy and not doing anything for my self and because of this I have seen so many opportunities pass me by because all I wanted to do was to make her happy because she took me into her home whenever I was homeless and I feel like I owe her so much for potentially keeping me alive. I do not want to see her upset but at the same time I am only 20.I feel like there is so much that I want to do before I get old. I do not want to waste my twenties in a relationship I am not sure I want to be in anymore but at the same time I am so scared to be alone because I do not think anyone else will ever want to be with me I wish I could just pack my bags and move to the other side of the world and start my life fresh and not tell anyone where I was going.I am sorry for such the long story I love yous all Trapped..",Depression,right know going sound like biggest gurn ever really feel like need get chest time writing years age relationship years living together one year thought happy looked back life recently filled many regretswhen family got kicked house person renting decided sell leaving us homeless mum dad able stay sisters house able stay girlfriends thought sorted weeks turned months got house whole time working bar long late shifts sleeping properly constantly sick got house sorted three months later covid hit put furlough three months opening went back work girlfriend got place live together things good whenever went back work worked mornings always evening shifts never really got see came home crying many times making depressed felt bad leaving time decided find new job keep happy job like able finish made happya year passed feel like trapped feel like spent last years stuff make happy anything self seen many opportunities pass wanted make happy took home whenever homeless feel like owe much potentially keeping alive want see upset time feel like much want get old want waste twenties relationship sure want anymore time scared alone think anyone else ever want wish could pack bags move side world start life fresh tell anyone going sorry long story love yous trapped,right know going sound like biggest gurn ever really feel like need get chest time writing years age relationship years living together one year thought happy looked back life recently filled many regretswhen family got kicked house person renting decided sell leaving us homeless mum dad able stay sisters house able stay girlfriends thought sorted weeks turned months got house whole time working bar long late shifts sleeping properly constantly sick got house sorted three months later covid hit put furlough three months opening went back work girlfriend got place live together things နောက်ကျောအလုပ်ကိုသွားသည့်အခါတိုင်းကောင်းသောအချိန်၌နံနက်ခင်းတွင်အမြဲတမ်းအိမ်သို့မသွားနိုင်ခဲ့သည့်အချိန်၌ပျော်မွေ့သောအရာများစွာကိုခံစားခဲ့ရသည့်အတွက်ပျော်ရွှင်သောခံစားမှုမျိုးသည်ပျော်မွေ့ခြင်းကဲ့သို့သောပျော်ရွှင်မှုကိုခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ ဆန္ဒရှိချင်သောအခြားသူမည်သူမဆိုသည်အိတ်များကိုရွှေ့နိုင်သည်။

12561,"If you are in a bad headspace please do not read this.I [22M] am slowly starting to give up on life. I hoped things would get better but they have not and do not show any signs of changing. I am currently living at home with my verbally abusive mother in a very toxic environment. I want to move out aspa, but I am working a sh*tty job that does not pay well and if I do save up enough. I would be broke for the foreseeable future. I have seen so many CV councillors and applied to so many jobs, and despite all of that I have not been offered any interviews.To sum up my love life, it has been pain. I have never had a partner or anything like that. Every now and again I match with someone we vibe and hit things off, but after a date or two I get ghosted, leaving me confused and hurt as to why they lost interest. I feel undesirable and unworthy of love. I feel like I need to be perfect in every way order to even be considered as a romatic partner. I feel the same way when it comes to job applications. it is mentally taxing and painful.All of this is having a massive effect on my mental health and I am noticing it deteriorating quickly. I hate that I am thinking about just ending it. But I guess I need to know when to quit, I have struggled with knowing when to quit all my life. I guess I was always the hopeful optimist. But what is the point in trying when put all my efforts in trying to make my life better and I still end up in the same place. I keep telling myself be strong, I hype myself up into a positive mindset and a good mood and for what? Nothing seems to change, well nothing permanent. The cycle continues. It feels like everything is working against me, and simple things that should be straight forward are not.And I get life's not fair and I accept that, but it feels like the difficulty was dailed up to 1000 for me. I do not think anyone can save or help me. I have prayed and begged to whatever cosmic being might be out there. Praying for them to give me a break, give me a win, on which I can build on and make my life better. I do not know what I did to deserve this, whether is this life or past or whatever but I am sorry.I have got so much unresolved pain.I know life has it is rough patches but I would at least like some level of happiness.

The long version is: I laughed while eating a grape and it caused me to cough, it was more coughing than I'm used to and it burned a bit, so I was worried that I didn't cough it out well enough. I'm feeling a little tired now (6hrs later) and short of breath and my mucus is that sickly yellow. I felt immediate pain an hour after it happened but I don't feel it anymore, but most of these might be health anxiety.

34170,"Wheezing / constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couch-to-5K running program for about a month.  It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running.  I'm able to complete my runs fine, but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted.  I can force a deep breath, but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open.  Usually after about 30 - 60 min or so it's back to normal.

I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better, but was still there.  I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs.  He said my lungs sounded perfect.  And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold, since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound.  He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath, then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running (preferably when it stops being cold).

Anyway - just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support.  It is an irrational thing at this point, since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him.  Knowing the way my anxiety works, I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it (and to me it sounds strange) and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue (I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis - which definitely is in my head when anything lung-related is going on).  Any tips or other support would be fantastic!

PS - I refuse to google it (or anything else for that matter) but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too.  I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing.

I always think as long as it makes me happy it is okay, but then reality hits me and I feel like a failure.

Who has never celebrated their birthday with friends at 17? Who never had friends at 17? correct! Me!. I have been rejected too many times and I am tired of trying.

He recently got switched over to another job (the company he works for basically sends him and his team to different jobs as they are needed) and he hates it. Hes working from 3am-3pm and I cannot even imagine how hard that must be. Hes been struggling a lot and I am really trying to support him and stay positive, but its really hard sometimes. He barely talks to me. The most I have gotten to talk to him in the last two weeks is for 10 minutes a day. I want to be loving and understanding, because I understand how hard this is for him, but I am at a crossroad. Mainly because while I get this is very hard for him, it is for me too. As someone with anxiety (and some trauma from past relationships) I have communicated to him that I need at least a little bit of time to check up on him and talk to him. 20 minutes is enough for me. But hes been saying that because hes been depressed, he does not ever really feel like talking. I totally get that, and I do not want to because him any stress, but by doing that I am causing myself and my mental health a lot of pain.

9813,"how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now.

21299,"I (16F) live with my mother. My father left for ""work"" when I was very little. He never texted/called me (on my birthday once a year) or supported us financially. He comes home every 1-2 years for a ""visit"" and it is hell for me. My parents are not married, they do not really get along but they are not split up either. I wanted to have a dad like all my friends but now the deed is done and I want to cut him off. He feels like a stranger to me and I would not say that I ""hate"" him necessarily but sometimes I do. Whenever I try to explain this to my mom she says that he is my dad and that he loves me in ""his way"". Then I start crying and she starts screaming at me to stop because this is not a good reason. My mom makes me feel like it is my fault and that I am doing it for ""attention"" or ""on purpose"". I try to at least tolerate him but I cannot. I just remember the times when he once beat me really bad when we were on holiday (the only time but it stuck with me) or when he had s*x with my mother next to me and made me smell his hand after fingering her(I am sorry, this is really embarrassing but I had to say it because it is the biggest reason I hate him so much). I remember this like it is happening right now and often I cry about this. I was little and maybe they think I ""forgot"" or did not know what is going on. I tell my mom that I cannot stand him but never about these reasons, but i know for a fact she will gaslight me. I also remember the times he played with me but the things he did (doing the deed next to me, letting me hear them on holiday) were just horrible and traumatic. One time they did it in the bed i was supposed to be sleeping in and the sheets were all sweaty and gross, and they let me sleep in it. I might be overreacting though. 2 years ago he stayed like 2 months and I am scared he will want to stay this long too this time. Also the last year I have struggled with an eating disorder and I lost like 100 lbs, and he remembers me like being chubby. I am almost fully recovered now and learning to accept myself and my weight gain and he will make some comments that I do not wish to hear, I do not want to relapse. This year I will go to my grandmother while he is at my house and I hope to not be forced to see him. Now that is the whole thing, I do not hate him because he left me but because of those sexual things. I am fully AWARE being abandoned does not count as abuse and I completely agree and I do not hate him for that, but for the other things he did. Whenever I said something that did not sit right with me he was like ""Come on you are grown up, you are not 2 years old so you can understand those things"" and making me feel like it is my fault. I just moved home after 3 months of staying at my grandmother (my house was in renovations) and I was really excited to come back home. I had plans for summer and now he is coming to fuck my entire summer break, I have to stay at grandma's... I really wish he is stay at a hotel or something. he is calling my mother (to tell her he is coming) and i have so much anxiety. I wish she would understand me and would not let him in. I have to make my luggage. My mom tells me I am exaggerated. I thought about killing myself just to make her feel guilty, to make her feel all that I felt. I am such a horrible human.

33968,"Should a low blood pressure and pulse rate be concerning at an odd time? I was at this enormous concert recently (over 10,000 people in one room, 5 big screens, lord knows how many speakers, etc). It was the first concert I've ever been to because I don't really like loud noise, but there were a couple speakers there I wanted to see (it was more of a conference with several hours of music). Previously unbeknownst to me, the music was incredibly loud and there were continuous lights flashing all different colors and directions. I'm a pretty introverted, quiet guy so this wasn't my idea of a good time, but that's not confusing.

What confuses me is that my pulse dropped. It was a day long event, but I'm in good shape so I doubt that was an issue. I noticed because I started getting dizzy, got a headache, and was tired enough to sit and close my eyes amidst all the *hype*. To my chagrin and embarrassment several people asked me if I was okay (which I appreciated but felt deeply uncomfortable with). My resting heart rate is about 64, and I'd thought it'd be elevated with the very overwhelming (to me at least) stimulus for an extended period of time. Instead, I measured it, and it was right at 42. Wtf was going on? I didn't leave because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time, but seriously, is something wrong with me? No one else had this. It made me feel alienated and uncomfortable when I should have been having a great time. I've never had a panic attack or any prolonged health issues so idk what happened. Was this just an anxiety thing or is that an actual health issue. I'm not going to ask anyone because frankly it was embarrassing. To clarify I'm not ""asking [you] to diagnose"" anything, I just want to if anyone has felt something similar. Thanks in advance for any help.

I have been on my meds since December and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. Today I woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. Our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. We live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. Well our indoor cat, she got out last night because of me. Because I am too selfish and greedy that I could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke, my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail, I can tell my brother resents me for this I understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. I am not even man enough to admit that I was smoking and that is why she got out. My mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways, still does not hurt any less. I have been suicidal for a little while now but to chicken to do anything about it but honestly this was the last thing I needed and it may have been the thing to push me over the edge.

I have documented the last 15 months since being discharged. I have tried different medications (a lot) for my residual symptoms. Equilibrium and gait issues, depression and anxiety, cognitive issues and most importantly my severe neuropathy. If I didn’t take my medicine I was so itchy and uncomfortable I would be clawing at my feet and legs and actually leaving pretty big cuts. I was losing my train of thought and having trouble finding certain words. I have been in the medical neurology field since I was 19, I’m 34 now. I know about medical issues and treatments and all of them have such a negative impact on daily life. I had to make a change. I started taking CBD oil and weaned myself off all my meds. I feel great. My thinking has improved. My speaking skills are on point now. I am no longer losing bits and pieces of a conversation. I wish I did this sooner. Like I said I recovered, but I was left with a lot of symptoms, things that my grandparents are complaining of and even though I’m only 34 this is my life now. I can’t go on the rest of my life taking pills everyday. So now I take CBD oil in the morning and at night. I started out slowly and gradually increased it. I decided to start selling it to get a discount on my monthly oils. Im not a sales person but if I can benefit from this, I am sure other people in the same boat as me could too. I was desperate and willing to try anything and now knowing I can take something that is all natural and not made by a pharmaceutical company and it’s legal makes me feel so good.

20028,"Today is my son's birthday. 10yrs ago he was 6yrs old. We had a big party with all his friends and an Indiana Jones cake! We even had the 501st in attendance. For those who do not know, the 501st is a volunteer group of Star Wars enthusiasts that visit children in hospitals. My son had been diagnosed with a terminal cancer and passed away just 2 weeks later. I was also going thru a divorce at the time. My ""husband"", despite being my son's step-father and knowing my son since the age of 2, rarely visited us in the hospital and attempted to make me feel guilty on the occasions he did. I was also fired from my job, despite being a full-time employee for several years and requesting time off in advance. (that is, uh, service Industry for ya, I guess)Despite being homeless, jobless and grieving, I was determined to soldier on, so I found an apartment and lived in hermit-ude for another year and a half. In spite of a sketch boyfriend and an even sketchier ex-husband trying to worm his way back into my bed, I somehow managed to find a job and some emotional stability and even had another child!Things were kind of swell for a bit until.....they just were not. I was stuck at home all the time. The house was always ""under construction"" and I could not spend time with my friends.it is not one big thing, it is allllll the little things. I cannot tolerate living like this anymore. Everything is disorganized and chaotic. I do not have the energy to clean and even if I did, it would only make me anxious, as the entire house is a construction zone that we just so happen to live in. there is no exit strategy or end game, it is just my partner, subbing out jobs a couple of times a year to sketchass dudes who show up whenever, for the past 4yrs. Everything is covered in some type of tile dust or trim dust or plywood dust or sheetrock dust and I am apparently allergic to all of it. I take Zyrtek, Allegra, hydrozene and Benadryl daily.

I have had clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 13 years old, I am now 18. This summer I have reached an ATL, or an all time low. I was hospitalized in January of this year and did not think my situation could get worse from there. I was wrong. I have driven away all of my friends with my erratic behavior and selfish choices, including my best friend from high school who I considered to be a platonic soul mate. I miss them and think about them every day, but they want nothing to do with me. I have never felt more alone than I have this summer. Luckily, my boyfriend of 2 years has stuck around, but today I found out that I am pregnant with his child. I am going to college in the fall and I am not ready to be a parent.

My problems around a year ago were so trivial, so meaningliss. My problems now are unfixable. I blame my mom for them happening I cannot help it. Last year I started university. Within the first 3 weeks I realised the course was not for me. I told my mom hoping to get some support. Instead she texted my older brother who started saying I am stressing my mum out and that I have not given it a proper chance. He probably said some nice things as well but I cannot remember if he did. Those bits stuck out. I could have got my money back for the year and that ordeal would have been the end of it. I would have given university a go and I would have walked out feeling alright about myself, a bit of regret but alright. I had an okay first term, the second I just hated. Long story short the people I was meant to be living with next year were all scumbags. I did not want to go back in the third term and made that very clear. My mom probably cared but it did not matter, in her eyes I was being an idiot who was going to throw away another crappy opportunity. She screamed, cried and eventually I thought it would be better if I just went. Low and behold they were assholes and I came back. The third time I went back before I went I told her everything and she still thought I should go back. I decided to give it one more shot and it was the worst decision of my life. I got no help from the college. I now feel like a broken man. I resent my mom and brother, I feel like our relationship is truly broken. I do not want to be here anymore, I want to die I feel like if I leave home I will almost definitely kill myself as I have no qualifications and the best I will get is some studio apartment.

I was depressed and had panic attacks, and thanks to those meds i am now more aggressive, less caring and every day i am pushing all the people that were my friends away, just to not feel guilty that my death will destroy their lives.I have a loving girlfriend and about 7 friends i care deeply about, they are the only people that make me wait with ending it all. I am 23, nearly 24 and I cannot be an adult. I act childish, I escape into books and videogames, I failed 2 years of my colleague and I really want to pass it this year, but I do not think I am able. cannot focus, everything scares me, I need to escape, distract myself. My own head is my prison. If I do not distract myself with games or books, i keep thinking of how much of a failure I am. Walking sack of meat, wasted resources. do not know any usefull skills besides being supposedly charismatic. My loved ones told me so, but it is probably from pity. They love me but every day they must think about me not moving forward. Everyone does evolve and get better and I cannot. I just want all this to end. I need help, or I will do something they will regret. I feel like I have been cotributing nothing to their lives. I wish they stopped caring so I can off myself and finally escape this wretched place. I just cannot, I can see the few people that care about me, even though I tried to push them away. All the sadness, their staring at my dead corpse would scar them for the rest of their life, and pain and suffering would be the only thing that I left behind. Shall I wait more, until they really will stop caring? I cannot just kill myself, it would be a killing blow for them. They love me and I love them to but I am an error, taking up space. The worst thing is that I cannot tell them how I feel, they would instantly treat me like a lunatic, insane, they would treat me like a poor little hurt animal, and it is nearly as bad as just seeing me dead. It would just slowly kill me and them. I do not know, i do not know. Maybe I should just walk away from home and just see what would happen to me. Just drive as far as I can afford and then walk until i collapse. I am deeply depressed, I do not know what to do. Get better? End it all? Tell my loved ones for filthy pity and care that would case me to be even more of a burden. I do not know. Never tried to take my own life, but I really fantasy about it.

34344,"A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so I will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (I've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, I've been this way since September. So, I'd be dead by now. 

Some of those symptoms are, like I said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. Minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, I wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux, which I was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, I'm still having that.

Has anyone else had sharp chest pains from anxiety? I've had stomach pains from stress/anxiety, but have any ladies also had pains in their uterine/ovarian area from it?

My girlfriend of two years left me for another guy, my car keeps breaking down, I saw my ex today, she told me how she still loves me but could not make it work anymore, after that I wanted to go on a ride on my motorcycle, to maybe feel a little less shit, but less than one km after leaving it is engine blew up (the funny thing is I study automotive engineering and I am a racecar mechanic. Everyone of my friends ask me to fix their shit, but mine still breaks without any prior signs). I was in a clinic for the last 4 weeks because of depression, got diagnosed with 3 different personality disorders, but they where like yeah you can go home now. I told them I am scared of being home alone in the flat I used to share with my ex, because I am possibly suicidal (creeping thoughts that get louder and louder every day), but they did not care and sent me home. I feel like I am a burden to all of my friends, which is why I am scarred to talk to them. I know ist not like that but still. I got a big problem with opening up to others and that feeling makes it even worse. I must sound like a broken record because I am telling the same shit for months now, but it keeps getting more and worse. I got no energy to get even one of my problems in order, but there are so many and the longer I do not fix them the worse they get. I am thinking about suicide every day in the last week's, but I will not do it. The scarry thing is, I do not know how long this will stay the truth. I just hate my life right now, I hate my self in general and honestly I kind of lost hope. I just think the world is a horrible place to be.

I never really had many friends in life I can rely on either. I reached out to a few acquaintances but ultimately after a few kind words they stopped talking to me. 2 years later, after extensive therapy and AA work I am better and have a better job, I am more fit and generally happier. I have also had an easier time making friends and getting dates through online apps. However I noticed I still do not trust any of these people, because I always remember deep down when I needed help the most and someone to just talk to, the only help I got was myself, so I am jaded because I do not trust people to be there for me anymore, not when I really need them.

17376,"I spent what feels like an entire lifetime as a paramedic, and over the course of a decade of working in public safety I have seen and been through some extraordinary circumstances. I took pride in my career, loved every minute of it, and miss it every day. For the past three years my life has been ripped apart by moments, ones that are seemingly and endlessly stacked one on top of the other, that I thought I would never- ever experience. I was blindsided by a brutal divorce with my ex three years ago who has since ruined my reputation, continues to use an incredibly immoral backdrop narrative in the courts against me, and is relentless in her attempts to make my life worse every day. **Bad karma, right?** A year and a half ago I lost my career, I was getting brutalized in this horrendous divorce, and my parenting rights were stripped from me. I entered into a horrendously depressive state, and I knew that I needed to get help. So- that is exactly what I did. Just like every patient (hundreds if not thousands over a decade) that I had taken to the hospital for mental health dilemmas- I checked myself into the hospital during my absolute worst moments. is not it funny how... in the worst of moments- everybody in your life wants to be there, wants to be the hero, wants to help... but when the chaos has passed all those same people are nowhere to be found? You only gain that perspective when it all unfolds in front of you, and I still shake my head at that realization. Some remain, but even those that have still view me in a different light.After my stay in the hospital, I was committed to getting my life back together. I found a therapist who has helped me immensely, I got sober from alcohol completely, and all I wanted was to have my daughter back.The stigma of it all, and those single moments of me reaching out for help by going to the hospital, have followed me endlessly in my child custody battle. Despite doing everything that the PC attached to our case has asked me to do- I still do not have my daughter back with me in any significant amount of time. I am still run over by my exs brutal tactics in court, and nothing I achieve, or gain seems to make any difference. That single hospital stay has ruined the most important pieces of my life- and that is being a father to my daughter.I used to tell patients all the time that going to the hospital to get help would only make things better for them. I used to believe that. I want to still believe that. But.....**Where the hell is my karma?** Because I am starting to think this karma thing is no longer working for me. The stigma of mental health permeates every subtle conscious thought of those who start to look at you differently. Like you are completely alone in a crowded room. Like you are broken somehow... like damaged goods. You might be better, but the stigma remains. It has followed me like a shadow that I cannot get rid of, and all I want is to feel proud of addressing my mental health. I want to feel like I was honest when I told my patients to do the same thing. I want to be a success story for my daughter- showing the kind of strength it takes to overcome these painful obstacles. I want to feel like if I could redo it all over again- I would still do it the same way because I put in the work to heal myself from the worst of my moments. It has been a year and a half where my daughter is barely with me, and there is no logical reason for that except a subjective bias. The stigma of it all- it feels never ending, and all because I sought help. I am stuck in an absolute nightmare that I cannot wake up from.If the stigma follows you as it does me- know that you are not alone. You are NOT alone. It Is The Stigma That Has Ruined Me",Depression,spent feels like entire lifetime paramedic course decade working public safety seen extraordinary circumstances took pride career loved every minute miss every day past three years life ripped apart moments ones seemingly endlessly stacked one top thought would never ever experience blindsided brutal divorce ex three years ago since ruined reputation continues use incredibly immoral backdrop narrative courts relentless attempts make life worse every day bad karma right year half ago lost career getting brutalized horrendous divorce parenting rights stripped entered horrendously depressive state knew needed get help exactly like every patient hundreds thousands decade taken hospital mental health dilemmas checked hospital absolute worst moments funny worst moments everybody life wants wants hero wants help chaos passed people nowhere found gain perspective unfolds front still shake head realization remain even still view different light stay hospital committed getting life back together found therapist helped immensely got sober alcohol completely wanted daughter back stigma single moments reaching help going hospital followed endlessly child custody battle despite everything pc attached case asked still daughter back significant amount time still run exs brutal tactics court nothing achieve gain seems make difference single hospital stay ruined important pieces life father daughter used tell patients time going hospital get help would make things better used believe want still believe hell karma starting think karma thing longer working stigma mental health permeates every subtle conscious thought start look differently like completely alone crowded room like broken somehow like damaged goods might better stigma remains followed like shadow cannot get rid want feel proud addressing mental health want feel like honest told patients thing want success story daughter showing kind strength takes overcome painful obstacles want feel like could redo would still way put work heal worst moments year half daughter barely logical reason except subjective bias stigma feels never ending sought help stuck absolute nightmare cannot wake stigma follows know alone alone stigma ruined,သုံးစွဲသောလူထု၏လုံခြုံမှုကိုပြုလုပ်သောလူထု၏လုံခြုံမှုကိုပြုလုပ်ခဲ့သောလူထု၏လုံခြုံမှုကိုပြုလုပ်ခဲ့သောလူထု၏ဘေးဖယ်ခံမှုကိုတွေ့ရသည့်နေ့တိုင်းစိတ်ပျက်ဖွယ်ကောင်းသောအကျင့်ယိုယွင်းမှုဖြစ်သည့်နောက်နှစ်နာရီတွင်အငြင်းပွားဖွယ်ရာတရားရုံးများကိုမတွေ့ကြုံခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ ကွာရှင်းခြင်းဆိုင်ရာမိဘအုပ်ထိန်းမှုအမျက်ဒေါသထွက်နေသည့်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျသည့်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျသည့်ပြည်နယ်များအားဆေးရုံမှည့်သောရှုထောင့်မှကြည့်ရှုရန်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျသည့်နေရာများနှင့် ပတ်သက်. လက်တွေ့ကျကျရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိရန်စိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာအနေဖြင့်ရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိရန်ကြိုးပမ်းနေသည်။ Moments Heart Mements Help Myanmar PC ၏နှလုံးသားအတွက်အစဉ်မပြတ်အလုပ်များသောအရာကနေမလွယ်ကူသည့်အရာတိုင်းတာ 0 န်များအနေဖြင့်ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သော ဆေးရုံမှစ. မည်သည့်အရာကမျှမတူဘဲနေသည့်စိတ်ကျန်းမာရေးကိုဆက်လက်လုပ်ဆောင်နေဆဲဖြစ်သည်ဟုယူမှတ်သည့်အမှုအစဉ်အဆက်ကအဘယ်အရာကိုယုံကြည်မှုရှိနေသည်ဟုယုံကြည်သည်။ ကုန်ပစ္စည်းများသည်ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သောအမည်းစက်ကိုပြသနိုင်သည့်စိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာအနေဖြင့်စိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာအနေဖြင့်လက်တွေ့ကျကျမှေးမှိန်သွားသောစိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာအနေဖြင့်စိတ်ဓာတ်မကျနိုင်သည့်အရာသည်အဆိုးဆုံးသောအခက်အခဲများကမကိုက်ညီဟုခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။

35055,"Can glandular fever cause problems years later? I contracted a bad case of glandular fever when I was 14, and was in hospital for a couple of months, on an IV, and even had to use a wheelchair as I lost so much weight. It took me four months to go back to school full time due to being so exhausted all of the time. Before all of that, I was mostly healthy, maybe a bit underweight and had an underactive thyroid, but I was healthy. It was also around this time that I began struggling with manic depression and anxiety, which I am now medicated for.

I’m now 19, and my thyroid has began working normally again but I am constantly ill. I have colds at least once a month, if theres a flu going round I catch it, despite my best efforts to keep up with the preventative measures. I had 7 chest infections last year. 7. I recently was hospitalised for a kidney infection, then haemorrhaging ovarian cysts, and i’ve just been diagnosed with ANOTHER kidney infection just three months after the last one. Everything else (I’m told) by doctors is healthy, I’ve had blood and urinary tests, ultrasounds and countless antibiotics and multivitamins. In addition to these other symptoms I’ve developed psoriasis and my hair is falling out, and I’ve also lost most of my toenails. I’m beginning to get embarrassed about being ill so often, and that people might think I’m making it up.

I can’t help thinking this is all somehow linked to developing glandular fever. I know its possible to have long term ME afterwards, but I was wondering if anyone has a similar story regarding this?? Ive been to countless doctors about the various symptoms but none have gotten any better. Ive gotten so frustrated I have started to keep track of when I’m ill/ what symptoms I have and they’ve began to link together...

15666,"Hi! I will be as brief as possible and I will try to lay this out clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post!Background: I am going through rather a hard time at the moment. I had to take off work until September due to severe depression, which I have suffered with for about 7 years now. It came to a head last year, when my pretty horrible boyfriend of nearly a decade finally left me. This is the first time I have ever had to go on ""sick leave,"" and I hate it. I am so, so lucky that I have this option, but I still feel embarrassed and frustrated that it is come to this point. Problem: I have been seeing a psychologist and he always tells me to make friends. he is been harping on it for the last few weeks and this last Friday he gave it to me as my ""homework,"" for our next session. Truth be told I really, really want a good friend because I have never actually had one before. My problem is that I have already *tried* to make new friends, and it went horribly. Back in February he gave me a similar piece of ""homework,"" and I ended up emailing some people I know pretty well from work and church. I worked hard on the emails, personalized them, and I had really high hopes when I sent them out. Hopes which were dashed when nobody responded to any of the emails. I feel crazy admitting this, but this put me in a pretty horrible state for a while and really killed what was left of my self esteem. I honestly do not think I will ever be ready to do that again, because another rejection like that could actually kill me. I do, however, recognize that I have to pull myself back up and try again if I ever want to get better.Question: What is the safest way for a very sensitive, sad woman to make friends? Is there any way to reach out to people with less risk of rejection? All the mental health websites I can find recommend ""reaching out to people,"" or ""making friends"" but none of them tell me what to do in the event that nobody wants to be my friend. I am just really, really scared of being rejected again.

33953,"One hell of a year Hi, just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this. For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol' Dr Google. Fast forward countless doctors appointments, a spur of the moment ER visit, CT Scans, and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I don't have any life threatening conditions. 
I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious (of course they were fine). 
I mean, I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual, so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However, I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy, I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that I've had for the last 7 months. It's honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things. Anyone else have issues like this?

A father that is not a selfish psychopathic lunatic, a brother that is not a delusional sociopathic prick or a mother that is an irrationally fragile creature. Imagine being stuck in the same house for almost 18 years with nowhere to go, no freedom, no rights, no dignity, no respect, no nothing. No friends to hang out with, no relatives to call on, no girlfriends to talk to. I have been subjected to physical, mental and emotional torture and abuse from a very early age both at home and school. Every waking moment of my life is nothing but filled with despair, sorrow and guilt. Misfortune after misfortune, failure at every waking step. If that was not enough I also suffer from extreme emotional trauma, PTSD, depression, anxiety disorder....the list goes on. I cannot even put into scale the level of emotional breakdown I endured as an 11 year old all the way through now, all of those years and I never had a therapist or counsellor. You are probably wondering why I never called one. Well the thing is I just cannot and the reason for that is because my father happens to be the cheapest mf on this planet. This guy does not spend any money on anything whatsoever rather then buying groceries and essential home restorations or articles. He saves each and every penny just for his pension, that is all he cares about. I cannot even report for abuse or neglect since he is extremely manipulative and a drama queen. He would simply spin the narrative around to blame the whole thing on me backed by my brother and mother. Why would anyone even believe me since I am only a kid. I cannot go anywhere, I cannot do anything; there is no one to help me. There is just hopelessness and self loathing from the moment I rise in the morning to the moment I retire to bed, the same cycle, the same shit. Every day, every week, every month; nothing changes. I cannot even fathom how I have not gone insane after all this shit. There was so much I wanted to do in life, discover and explore, find a meaning or purpose, get married, have kids, maybe even do some volunteer work. it is all in vain now, everything's a waste. Nevertheless it does not matter anyway, I am not looking for some sympathy or consolation or anything, that phase has already passed out ages ago.

22024,"I want to tell my story before I die. I have dealt with mental health issues my whole life. I have tried harder than anyone can expect or should need to. My earliest memories are of my father coming home drunk and high. Beating my mother. I would hide under the bed and play dolls with my sister. So she would not hear him beating her. I always wanted friends but never had any. I was the weird kid. I could not go into anyone's house unless invited. I remember peeing my pants outside the door because I was not invited in. I remember my father living 20 minutes down the road but never being there. Only holidays to look good in front of his parents. I remember my mother's family hating me. Telling me I would be just like him. How men are worthless. My stepfather beating me. How they would blame me and say I was lying. I remember being kicked out of the house while still in school for defending her when he raised a fist at her. Hitting him. Making him cry for his mom. I am not a good person I get it. I remember being homeless. I remember meeting my wife at my second job. Breaking into my grandparents house while they were gone for the winter. Drinking too much because I just wanted it to stop and the blackouts gave me peace. I remember the few years of happiness I had with my wife. Well as close to as someone like me can have. I remember us going to school and planning a future. I was going to be a chef. She wanted to be a writer. I remember the knock on my door. Hearing she was not ok. The hospital. Seeing her. Them telling me to call her family. Calling them. Not knowing what to say. She got a headache at work. She just started crying after sitting down and passed out they said. They sent her to a bigger better hospital. I remember driving there. I drove so fast. Reckless. They took her by helicopter. They did tests. I remember they told me she had an aneurysm. She was brain dead. Them asking me to sign papers to have her unplugged. To donate her organs. Her brother wanting her father to see her again. Her father that molested her. That molested more than her. Went to prison for it. I remember stalling so he could see her. I do not know if that was the right thing to do. I hated him. But she was his daughter. And for some reason it was important to her brother. I remember he was not supposed to touch her. I remember him touching her anyways. I remember breaking. I was already broken. I have been bipolar my whole life. I remember signing the papers to take her off life support. Not being able to be there when she passed. It was too much. I apologize. I was a kid. I could only handle so much. I was 23. I killed her with the stroke of a pen. You can say she was brain dead and already dead. But that was what ended it. I remember getting mail that told me about how her organs saved lives. Calling her family, even her father to them. I do not remember the next few years well. I drank a lot. I was trying to kill myself. I stayed with her family some and mine. I made unforgivable mistakes. I got angry. I came close to killing. I remember pulling a knife. I was going to commit suicide by cop. I remember the multiple times I tried to get help. I remember giving up. Going to a group home. Just hoping. I would get help. Trying so many medications. Counseling. Being left to rot. I spent near a decade there. I tried anything they offered. I failed me. They failed me as well. Never following through. Promising things that never happened. The group home was infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. Covered in bites always. My roommates all needed help that none of us got. I was jumped and had teeth broken out for being mistaken for one that was a sexual offender. After years of trying I had to leave as another was bringing weapons into the house. we would drink together. he would pull out one.

12444,"I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but all I want to do is cry. Fuck, I need a hug. vent",Depression,honestly fucking hot hot past months really know going first thought burnout uni feeling uni form escapism graduated feel like shit emotional mess back april feel numb still overly care people important things mood static happy anymore sad anymore beyond tired past years intense school personal stuff overachiever cgpa near grad school far career wise life good prime feel confident year alone close friend sibling suicidal first dude ever truly liked turned also similar led codependent chaser parents barely able pay mortgage due unemployment dads health steadily declining pcos shattered self image worth sibling parents fight constantly parents fight constantly fucking odds every year tell next year going better end disappointing like never catch break literally know anything personal boundaries quick commit people realized never apparently caring much others trauma response totally makes sense eldest daughter dysfunctional immigrant family learned young age set aside others therapist peacemaker tutor caretaker family members feel like passing threshold tolerance fucked track becoming physician want care people know continue like going end probably yeeting even finish training need bit night simple self care makes feel beyond guilty feel fucking lonely want left alone anything fucking sick shit push trying hard keep mental grip want cry fuck need hug vent,ရိုးရိုးသားသားရူးသွပ်ခြင်းသည် UNI Form Uni Form uni ဟုထင်ရသည့်အစဉ်အလာများကအလွန်အမင်းစောင့်ရှောက်မှုပိုမိုများပြားလာသည်ဟုခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ အဖေကအလုပ်လက်မဲ့ဖြစ်မှုအဖေကအဖေကအလုပ်လက်မဲ့ဖြစ်ရတဲ့ PCOS စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျသင့်တဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့အလေးသာမှုတွေဟာအလေးမငြိမ်ဖြစ်နေတဲ့အလေးမငြိမ်နေရတဲ့အလေးမငြိမ်နေပါဘူး။ မိသားစု 0 င်များသည်ချည်နှောင်မှုဒဏ်ကိုခံနိုင်ရည်ရှိသည့် truction track fuck ဆိုတဲ့လမ်းကြောင်းကိုဖြတ်သန်းသွားစေချင်သည်။ စိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာချုပ်နှောင်ထားသည့်အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုဖြတ်တောက်ခြင်းကိုနှစ်သက်သောအရာတစ်ခုခုကိုဖြတ်သန်းခြင်းကိုလိုချင်သည်မှာစိတ်ပိုင်းဆိုင်ရာချုပ်နှောင်ထားသည့်အရာတစ်စုံတစ်ခုကိုစားရန်လိုသောစိတ်ရှုပ်စရာကောင်းလောက်အောင်လုပ်ရတာစိတ်ရင်းမှန်ဖြင့်ခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။
34361,"Testicular Cancer I'm like 90% sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago, i got a sharp pain in my testicle, immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer, I was shaking, etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain, chest pain, etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months, so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad, same with abdominal pain, etc. They did an EKG, chest x-ray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high, also my blood pressure was high (but it always has been so not really worried), then I had a Chest X-Ray after I did that and got the results back saying ""all clear"".. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho, they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. 

After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam, the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle, didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.

So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest X-Ray. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches, fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week..

12996,"I am just so tired and alone and never thought Id really be typing on fucking Reddit but I am just all alone. Unless you have time Id probably just leave this post. it will probably be long and Ill probably immediately delete it anyways. Alone is a really weird feeling because how can you be alone while technically surrounded? Well as someone who has a family who has a couple friends I have no one that I can express myself with. I have no one and nothing. I was going years of not telling anyone anything of the about my mental health and just trying and trying to believe what my dad said everything is mental. Even if that is true it does not mean you can control it. They way I think and how I rationalize things has lead me to be so alone. I am sure there is so much more but I feel like it comes from that. From me being too scared to tell anyone anything in fear of them leaving me more alone that I already am. I feel as I am a she will of myself because I am expected to be this person I have spent years and years faking in order to be accepted and liked and wanted and its not me its a form of everything I think I needed to be and I feel as if I am trapped in my own body. Any time I ever express real feelings I end up hurting someone or someone elses feelings. Right now everything in my body is screaming to stop typing and delete this but if I do that then what. I am already here. I apologize for anything and everything I do even before I do it just out of fear of not being liked and wanted and being alone but then I pause and start to think I have never been liked or wanted its only even beeen the fake me.I was with my ex for 3 years and after a lot of research and trying to self heal I have learned the term grooming and learned that was done to me. Out of a sense of love and obligation I allowed myself to basically be stripped of anything good about me or anything I liked or had any interest in in order to be loved and liked to have a family. Long story short I lost myself and I did not talk to any friends or family for 3 years and after getting back to them I feel as if I am always auditioning and I am back to doing anything just to have someone around me but now I know that I am not being liked for me and anytime I ever show anything that is truly me I somehow validate my negative thoughts and rationalize them to be right and I know that is wrong but I am 24/7 screaming in my head fighting with thoughts and screaming at me to stop and begging just for some help and weed barely helps anymore. I do not want to drink but drinking is about the only time now when I do not feel sad. And I am able to literally drown out the thoughts. And i cry everytime I think about anything because I now know how sad Thais all is and the fact that no one knows except i started telling my mom a tiny bit about the negative thoughts and voices and now all I can think about is how me telling her worried her and scared her and I hate myself even more now and I genuinely did not think that was possible. The problem is, that I do not think I am ad guy or anything like I played plenty of sports growing up and had lots of friends and was popular I guess I had plenty of girlfriends and was actually liked by people and friends but I do not where that went I do not feel like him I do not feel me. I literslly do not feel like me. The only time I ever do is en I am all alone like iwatch videos or listen to music loud enough to anyone can hear it so that thEy do not think I am weird or I do not honestly even know I just do not want to be alone anymore I want to be liked and wanted for me and I do not see that happening ever. I feel too much pressure to even talk to anyone let alone be around them for longer than a passing by. I feel as If I am being shown pity anytime anyone talks to me or is around me. I feel as if its all just to make me feel better. Vs actually wanting to be around me for me. I do not think I am good anymore and I think its over honestly. I am just so tired of everything and the pressures and the feelings that come with literally opening my mouth or being around anyone. If I am not alone I cannot laugh without crying on the inside. I literally stop myself from laughing or feeling good by non stop negative thoughts pounding in my head and I scream and scream stop and help but I cannot get them out. I rationalize all of them and believe them to be logical and true and I am even in more pain that I am already in. I am so tireeeed please help actually I do not need help I just want to be wanted? No one understand the person I am. I try to express myself at times and it only ever leads to others getting hurt from my feelings. I feel as if I am not good enough anymore unless I am alone but I am tired of being alone. Alone is painful alone is basically like being around 2849472937293637494 people who hate you and are telling you why at every second and thinking that everyone hates you or that they pity you or doing a favor or anything. I spend every waking moment trying to make others happy because when I do that I can at least know that for that second that person knows that it was ME that made them happy. And its getting to the point where I am running out of energy for everything I can barely finish laughs I can barely be in a public setting especially not sober. I am sorry for burdening everyone with this I could have kept going but its getting hard to type with all the tears. I hope everyone is okay always if anyone needs any help please let me know Ill do whatever I can to help somebody not feel any percent of this. I seriously will.

With sites like Ebay, or amazon, it takes away the social aspect. - You cannot have deeper, meaningful time with family, or friends, because everyone is always updating their life on social media and nobody cares about what is going on around them anymore. - To follow that, everyone lacks discipline and attention spans. - Malls used to be a cool, fun place to meet friends, but with corporate giants like Amazon...well, you see the issue. - People seem to have a very hard time staying on topic. Social media has created positive feedback loops that encourage one to spout opinions and tell stories instead of further the conversation. People now crave one-sided conversations because they need the validation of their life story being ""liked."" - Depression...itself. I feel like social media romanticizes, and makes fun of people with depression a bit. I can go on and on for another hour, but these ones stand out to me the most. The internet is a very useful tool, and not the actual issue. The problem is that social media takes away the connection we used to have to each other, and for me, I feel like if I had more connections with people outside of the internet, my life, as well as many other's, would be much better off.

I know the stress of preparing for it has definitely kicked off a lot of feelings of being insecure in my abilities but I think it goes deeper than that. I just get stuck in these thinking ruts and my mind becomes completely cloudy - I have talked through some of these feelings before and it seems like when I have a problem I start either putting up invisible barriers or I think of all the things that could go wrong and it ends up closing off my mind to solutions before I even get a chance to think anything through. I cannot catch a thought and hold onto it long enough to solve anything - my mind just keeps spinning from problem to problem with no solutions. And I have always had this issue to some degree but I could work through it until several months ago, when I was offered this job. I went from feeling comfortable and relatively confident before, to feeling like I do not measure up to anyone around me. Suddenly I am not talented enough or I am not intelligent enough or I am not creative enough or I am not likeable enough when I am around other people. And I know part of this is my on perception working against me but for some reason I cannot shut it off; it is like the irrational, scared part of my brain is taking over. It makes me feel completely disconnected from the people around me and I end up feeling terrible and not confident about myself. I have read about the concept of a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset; that embodying a growth mindset helps you overcome feeling stuck by believing you can grow as a person whereas a fixed mindset leaves you stuck in a rut. Just rationally, I know I should have a growth mindset to believe that I can grow and change but my emotions are overwhelming my ability to choose that - something in me is constantly telling me that I am stuck being a failure, that I do not deserve good things, and that I have only made it as far as I have due to sheer luck.

When I tell them about my problems, how I feel so tired of life and fatigued, they just tell me that I am young and I need to not take things seriously, because life is going to get tougher. I am just so sick of the lack of support. I spent most of these sessions telling them more about my symptoms, getting into progressively serious ones, and they just dismiss them. They tell me 'not to think about it', or 'be grateful for what I have'. do not get me wrong, I am grateful, and I already avoid thinking about 'it' to prevent crying, but Id still like to know how to get out of bed in the morning and not want to die. I am at the end of my rope, and done with therapists etc but my mom wants me to see one more. Does anyone else have advice on how to get these professionals to see that you have a serious debilitating problem that is affecting your day to day life, that I am not just going through 'being young', and how to stop them from giving you tough love and give genuine coping strategies? They do not believe me when I say I have actually tried everything (working out somewhat regularly, clean diet, cutting out toxic people and even fucking breathing exercises). Honestly, Id rather take antidepressants and finally take my life off of hold- do not have the time or money for therapy. But I am scared of going to another psychiatrist, trauma dumping and still being told that I should just struggle with this (when I am obv not coping and it is just getting worse) instead of 'taking the easy way out'.

This is the FIRST TIME I have asked for help anywhere. I have gamed my entire life, I got my first PC when I was 11 years old and now I am 23. I am still gaming and doing actually nothing with my life. At first, I would play like 10 hours a day since my parents worked all day so as soon as I got back from school I would play the rest of the day and do nothing else, not even homework. I was a top-of-the-class student but ever since I got into PC Gaming my notes eventually fell off so HARD. Only doing the bare minimum to be able to pass grades and focus on gaming. I dropped out of college at 18 to get a job and build my dream PC. I built my PC and have been playing constant League of Legends every day for 5+ hours a day. I do not even enjoy gaming anymore, I am super toxic and competitive and all I do is get mad and keep playing. I was so afraid of quitting League because I was very good and I felt so bad because I dedicated so many hours into this game to just quit and waste all that time without accomplishing anything or become a pro player. I have worked in about 15 Call centers because they pay really well and have not lasted more than 1 month or 2. I am basically there for the free training money and that is it. I quit the job and continue to play until I run out of my saved money.I have not played league for 1 month and I do not really miss it, I am just super sad that I wasted my time and League just goes on without me like I never really existed. I have moved to FPS games because I was very good when I was young but I am having a really hard time since I am getting so mad due to being super competitive. Last year I got into College again and got a part-time job, it all fell apart in the last 3 months because I wanted to play AGAIN. I have now built a new SUPER PC and I feel so miserable. :(Right now I managed to land a very good job, chill work from home only answering customer service emails. The sad part is after work is done, I game until 12AM and repeat the cycle. The idea of quitting video games is just so frightening and I feel like I need them. I am addicted to competitive esports trying to prove I am better.... , do not really play single-player games since I do not get to compete with other people. Please help me see the light out of this tunnel, I know I have the potential to become someone great but the lack of motivation and cycle of gaming addiction is blocking me off.

The docs told me that so long as it doesn't impede any daily functioning, hurt extremely bad, grow, or (and this is the biggest one) eventually protrude that I am healthy and in my head. 

I just feel like SOMETHING is there...I've gone to the point where I thought my muscle is deteriorating.

11386,"I am going to tell you that my mom and as dad are the best parents that a man like me could ever ask for and I am sorry for ending my life short. This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all.

34095,"Just looking for some advice. First, a little backstory (sorry if a bit long). 

Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough (I us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.

My doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate (between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working).  

Sorry for the wall of text, I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.

11156,"I do not know where to start this story but I recently turned 18 and I have spent the past two years mostly unhappy and anxious, I hated who I am and where I came from. As my dad died when I was nine years old, I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building, at-least that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasons.I held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope. Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died. Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it. I am still not sure if that is the truth, but sense then I have never entered my balcony. These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with. This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors. I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay (I am bisexual) and awkward. I always went home in a bad mood because of this. Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates. I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed. I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners, because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues. When COVID-19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense. All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did, and I almost succeeded. As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity, that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am. All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently, I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future. Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous. I began hating myself for being jealous and I am spiraling back down to where I was, in the past few weeks I have already missed a few college assignments, I need help to cope with these emotions, I do not know what to do anymore.

My job has become redundant but I do not wish to change as I do not think any other job is going to be better than the one I have. I cannot hang out with my close group of friends as they are either getting married or are in a serious relationship. Cannot socialize anywhere else due to the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. To prevent feeling lonely, I hang out with a group of people who are at least 5-7 years younger to me. But deep down, I feel out of place as they are in a different phase of life and have different interests. No other interests or hobbies. All this makes me lose interest in my life further.For a while I thought I was under a depression as this feeling of nothingness came on suddenly. I convinced myself that the depression is the reason my life is at a low point.But, recently I met a person who was diagnosed with clinical depression. That is when I realised what depression actually is. Compared to what the guy was facing, my life was a picnic. I had no problem in functioning and going about my daily life. For a brief moment I was relieved that I was not under depression.However, then the realisation hit me, ""If I am not depressed, then there is only one explanation for this funk in my life: I am just pathetic"". Ironically, this realisation of being a pathetic loser made me feel worse than when I thought I was depressed. At least, when I was depressed I could go to a psychologist and get myself treated. Being pathetic has no solution. It is just the way I am....If any of you are wondering about relationships..I have never had any. Not a single one. It is difficult for me to even maintain good relations with family members. I do not know how to read and react to social situations. All this while my justification for the lack of social skills was due to having Asperger's or some other autism.

I moved from a nice house to 2 shitty apartment.This all made me want to kill my self, I planned how to do it. I decided I had to talk out, and so I did on an impulse.

17051,"I am 18 yrs old and since 2018 suicide never really left my head To begin with when I went to high-school I lost a lot of friends due to the fact that I went to school far from the city I grew up.i ended up with no friends.in high-school my mother was the headmistress of the school so I never really knew if my classmates really wanted me as a friend or they wanted just because of the position of my mother.So I was 5/7 days of the weekend in that village my school was and the rest of the days I was with my father(my parents are divorced) I genuinely preferred him than my mother.I also had some bullies in the school .I never talked about them on the first year.So I got used to it and I did nothing.At least I had 2 new genuine friends.I really enjoyed spending time with them but to tell you the truth I never really liked that village as a place.Anyway at the end of the year I met an old friend and we started hanging out.That summer my friend from the school came to the city I live and we decided to hung all together.The same day when we were out i reconnected with 4 old friends.And we all connected(except the guy from my school)So 2 became 5 etc.At this point i was really happy and positive.2nd year of high-school began I had 2 friends in school and 5 friends in town.P.s my mother after the divorce had an affair but the 2nd year this guy went to live in France he was actually a good guy to me and to my mother he was more of a friend to me than a step-father and I did not really bother but when he left,my mother started an affair with his brother ffs. He was kind of okay but sometimes when my mum got angry with me(as always,there are many stuff that my mother did to me and my brother not all bad but that is for another story)he would play the father role to me and I hated it. I wanted to leave my mum to live her life without me, I do not know if I was a good son or a bad son. I tried to leave her alone(I eventually did this year and its painful for a mother) and I was thinking how she would take it.Thankfully covid-19 appeared(sorry for saying this)and I did not have to live in that place.I even held on better on my subjects.As you see i have not mentioned at all my love life in the story that is because I did not really have one as I avoided to make a relationship in that place cuz I hated it and I wanted to be far far away from it, its not that I could not make a relationship, as I rejected two girls not only because of the place but also due to my high standards(mostly the place though) On summer of the 2nd year one of my friends introduced me to a female friend of his.At first I did not really noticed her but when we met for a second time due to my lack of social skills she would make the talk andshe talked to me she was staring at me smiling and then I thought that she was just perfect. The next days I would always find ways just to meet. I felt like she was flirting with me as we were in a library and she placed sth with flowers on my head and she smiled then she placed it on her and I told her that she looks nice with it and she smiled again. She would ""randomly"" touch me i never found the courage to touch her in return.Anyway that was a nice moment for me but it ended up on rejection it was my 1st rejection as I never made the 1st move I have made only 3 relationships 1 rejection and I have rejected 5 girls(sometimes I would reject some girls because I was afraid)In 3rd year nothing happend due to covid-19 i did not have to go to that place and I even had more time to hang out with friends. At the end of that season(now) i had exams as well. I was not the best student even though my mother made it seem like I was . I never accepted it I did not want this to happen I did not want to give more reasons for my classmates to hate me.

20390,"Hello, I am Emma i guess. I am 18 by the way.Okay I am sorry if this dosent belong here, but I am going to try anyway. I guess i just need advice on what to do right now. I will try to keep my back story short. I lived in a small village in the middle of germany. My parents divorced when I was 3 and I lived by my mum. I guess I have been emotionaly necelect since childhood. I had big social issues my whole life and school was just lonly hell. After school I just got home and locked myself in my room and mostly dident even leave the house. I mostly spend my childhood in front of the TV or Phone. I dident know any better sadly. (Yt videos and Podcasts can realy simulate a social live, at least it wass all I had.)I slowly got more and more depressd. I ate unhealty (my mum was also obese.) and got obese. As long as i can remember I was 103kg with 16yo. I finished 2020(IDK what it is called in english ""Realschulabschluss"" 10 grade) and dident know what to do after that. I was mentaly a complete mess and was not in a good physikal form. I started a BVB Berufs vorbereitende Bildingsmanahme. Something like a brige jear that helps you to find a job. It was the first time in my life that i had a social new start with new people and I actually enyoud live, I actually started to lose waight and people actually wanted to talk with me.It was heaven. Okay...... Now let us start with the strange part.I am transgender. (I was born male)After I lost moust of the waight and was social aktiv I noticed that some things are just wrong.The first thing that has nothing to do with my gender, but I guess I should mention it anyway. I noticed that I am atractet to guys. Of couse woman are okay but I am blushing when I am sitting next to a hot guy.Then I did some resurtch on the Internet (porn) and found out about LGBT. ( I lived in a small christian village and school dident teach shit about this stuff.) I hated myself for months and I dident know that gay or Bi or anything exist, not even to speak from transgender people and the HRT. I just know that I am strange and just wrong. Okay... So that is that. I am sorry if this post is strange but I am just trying to tell you what happend from my perspektive.I found out about trans people. Everything resonated i guess. Moust of the hatred I still had for my boady even after I lost all this waight and I could have loved my boady, but I dident. It Could simply be describet as i hate my boady because it is male. In oktober 2020 the BvB got put under lockdown and we only had distance work. (Some school work per E-Mail)I lost the small social live I finaly had and was now permanently every day in my room. I dident talked anything meaningfull with my mum and my mental state fastly deckend to a new low. I hated my boady more than ever even if i just looked like a normal teenager. I was okay with the lonlynes and necelect but It was just enough. I simply wanted to die and to vanish from this world. All I thought about was that I hated my boady becouse i lost the chance of a coin toss. And that becouse of my fucked genes I would even whit HRT never be able to pass becouse of my whide shoulders and haight. I had no acces to working medication so my Plan was to just cut open my wrist and to just bleed out.My mum somehow noticed that something was wrong, probably because i got more aggressiv to her and had constant mood swings. She finaly got me a appointment to a terrible terapist and hoped that this will fix me. IDK. The terapist dident help me, she listend to me but dident give me any advice or anything.Later IDK how but seriusly fuck you and thank you god two months ago I got into a psycatrie ! I finaly got the fucking help I nedet. ^^. A fucking good psycatrist that actually helps me and talks with me and gives advice. I worked thro a lot of my past. (A lot of witch I wrote down here.)And a small social live whit other patients.I got relesed yesterday to be honest. ^^I am now living with my dad right now and the future is still in planning, but everything is okay right now. I am probably going to go to a new terapist. ( I am still not on HRT.) and figure the future out.

14125,"I have struggled with depression off and on for around 14 years. Currently, I am really struggling with depression and anxiety. I am trying really hard to find a way to manage it. I am exercising, going on walks, meditating, going to support groups, talking. Taking care of my mental health is a full time job at this point. My younger brother lives with me. He also has depression and struggles from social anxiety. I am trying my hardest to support him and be there for him. He wants to change. Hes putting some effort in and I am proud of him for that. Hes been trying to maintain a workout routine, hes been joining me on walks. Its just that I am tired of being the one to push him. I cannot be the one to make sure he gets up. I cannot be the one who makes sure he gets fresh air and goes on a walk or does something active. I cannot push him and me. I am tired at this point. He does not have any friends, does not talk to anyone outside of the family, never leaves home. I get sad thinking about him. Its hard to see someone you love struggle. Hes not the one to intrinsically push himself. Its always been my mom or I pushing him or someone else in the family. But I just cannot do it anymore. I feel guilty when I leave him alone in the house and I deserve to go out with my friends and have fun.Logically, I know I cannot force him to change. I cannot fix him. This is his war to fight. But I have a hard time emotionally detaching. How do I find peace with just listening when he needs it and leading by example? How do I learn to detach from his issues so I can focus on mine? How do I accept that I am not responsible for pushing him? How do I not get sad when I ask him to join my friends and I for lunch and he decides to stay home alone? Does anybody have any experience with a loved one who also struggles with depression? How do you maintain that boundary for yourself between supporting them and working on yourself?

She could have kids, so she did. She has issues that my friend told me I need to learn how to work with kids because she is like one. She lived in outdated times and would refuse to listen to change. She may have loved my birth father, but come to ask anything about him, she has no clue. This man is who she chose to have as a father? She does not know anything about him. My friend says she has trauma from all her life. Why did she give birth? It is likely nobody would like her, so she created friends. I am older. I can change a lot, but a lot is too late. The damage is done. I am likely to kill myself at some point because as I progress in life with changes I can make, I have to deal with the permanent damage that affects my quality of life.

I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

26724,"I am thinking I might add more. I have cut out personal names==================Unfriend me now to make this easier on yourself. I am going to kill myself now or kill myself later. Call the cops to ease your mind, no ones going to find me. Waste your time by telling you care when you do not, because I know when all seems good people do not care. Give me your reason that I am wrong to say such things. Say to me that you have been going through what I have been going through. People with double standards against me, that judge me ignorantly, deny it please, so you can feel better about yourself. I have had enough of every Christian with a double standard of love; you rather judge than get to know others. You do not know me, because you judge me. And I do not know you because I judge you. If you talk behind my back, you should grow up and talk face to face. But fuck that now, it is too late.So now, know me for the fucking piece of shit I am. I am a fool, I know nothing. But you are wise, discerned, you know many things. Tell me what ought to do. I am weak and broken. Yet you are strong.No more condescension. No more bullying. No more emotional abuse. For those who are wondering about Christianity, a lot of them are just broken imperfect people acting like they are perfect.They ignore fellow believer that struggles with depression. Some of them forgive you and cut you off, for something they did that they cannot see. Some them lie straight to your face saying that they care for you, and then go ignoring you. Some of them are your best friends, that say they are there for you; but then drop you like a stone when it gets too heavy. Some of them use you, and again for sake of their image, get rid of you, because you are brokenness is too much of a mess. Some of make falsehoods about you to justify what they say, when you really just need someone to talk to. Also I find it hard to believe that Christians would rather isolate you than love you.More than 5 years of wanting to kill myself. I cannot talk about it. People say I talk to much about it, shut me down. People say I should be happy, shut me down. People say I am not the only one, shut me down. Now I will not talk about it. Now, I will try to be happy. Oh now, I know I am not the only one. Tell me with your learned words, I am being unfair in my statements. Call me arrogant for saying these things for feeling this way. My heart has been filling up because I have been silenced by a hardened heart of people, and now it is spilling over. All I see is evil. Christians should not ignore someone who is struggling, we are supposed to represent Christ's love, but it seems these people get caught up in themselfs rather then share love. I am joining them, I am going to think about myself as I kill myself. No more Christains with double standards of love. People who are so focused on their image ethier online or in person; no more. Is too hard encourage others? Or is it just encouraging specific people you do not like? And again, for those who think I am always negative. You paint pictures that you want to see. Never hearing the broken. No more prejudice.Out of everything I cannot stand, the most is myself, so I am ending it. I am finding somewhere secluded. And it would be a shame to hear from me again after saying all this crap. I am making sure it is done. Also I do not want to be locked up, and go through the same thing that is making me type this.And for those thinking I am seeking attention, use your brain. Even if it is that, does not mean it is not a cry for help? But I have to prove to those who think like that. I am going to kill myself, do not worry. I could write book from this heart of pain and thought, so give me your wise words. Look at your heart and learn from yourself. This does not apply to everyone, but that does not mean by saying that, you are one the ones this does not apply too; judge for yourself; fucking look in the mirror and actually look. are not you wise? Or do you know that you know nothing? Both trains of thought gives you all the more reason to look at yourself.This is the only stage I am getting, my death. Let me make a splash, so you can forget about me. I am sorry I am unbearable, it is my fault that I am too much to bear. I am sorry I am annoying, it is my fault. Now with your knowledge, hear what I am actually saying. Fuck this rant for being stupid. I fucking do not deserve anything. Rape me with your words, and tell me how stupid I am between the lines, or something like that. This is sad. No one wants to truly die. However, if you force feed your own words into someone is mouth; not giving a someone a chance to speak, they will be voiceless. And voicelessness is what kills.

35724,"I don’t know what to do This is long I’m sorry. 

Symptoms started in January, just feeling off, super tired, nauseous, headaches almost everyday, always feel as if I’m about to get sick (hot throat, run down, feeling like lymph nodes were swollen, etc). At this time I was attempting to recover from binge eating disorder and going through a bout of seasonal depression, and my doctor said it’s the depression making me feel all this. Prescribed me Zoloft, which I took for two weeks and stopped because the headaches I got everyday were unimaginable. 

The feeling of something being off physically never goes away. Start to feel a constant ache in my ears down the side of my neck and under my jaw. I mean literally every second of everyday. Still frequent headaches. Still feel lymph nodes are swollen. Wake up one morning at the end of March and my throat feels worse than it has in 10 years. Go to medexpress and I have strep. I thought maybe that’s what it’s been all this time?! Antibiotics work after a few days on the throat but all other symptoms remain. 

Between February and March I went to an ENT who basically dismissed me and said I have TMJ, looked in my ears which he said looked perfectly healthy. So then I go to my dentist and he took an x ray of my entire head showing all jaw joints, which are normal. No sign of grinding. Looked confused when I told him right in the morning when I wake up is when I feel the best, then it gets worse throughout the day. Still gave me a mouth guard to wear at night but makes no difference. 

If I was in constant anxiety over this I would chalk it up to that but I’m really not. My CBC, diff, platelets, and all my chemistries were all normal, so that helps a lot. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. Constant headaches and nausea, with a weird ache/pressure/sensation (not painful or tender) in my ears, down my neck, under my jaw, with pain in my shoulders and the back of my neck sometimes. Some tinges of chest pains here and there.

Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then ""we"" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here. I guess some words of encouragement would be nice. I do not know... I hope you are all having a better night than I am.

35564,"Chest pain anxiety. CHD &amp; open heart surgery survivor. Apologies for this wall of text. I just need help. 

So I'm new to reddit and to this sub. I know that chest pain is a very common symptom/trigger of HA, but I haven't been able to find any resources about cases similar to my own, although I'm sure they must exist out there. 

So I am a moderately healthy 25 year old woman. I excersise, I eat healthy, I was slightly overweight as a teen, but I've been at a healthy weight for the past 4-5 years. I was born with a somewhat serious congenital heart defect (CHD), an atrial septal defect (ASD) to pe precise. At the age of 5 I received corrective surgery for this defect, and have been considered healthy and symptom free ever since this surgery. I have had no major health events since this time, and I have never had any sort of restrictions placed on my physical activity levels by my cardiologist. 4 years ago I entered into a long distance relationship with the man who would eventually become my husband, and it was around this time that my HA began. I believe it was triggered by my fears that something would happen to one of us while we were apart, and that we would never see each other again because of sudden death due to illness or a freak accident. I began to be plagued by images of him dropping dead of a heart attack or getting hit by a car (same for myself). We lived in 2 different countries, and usually spent 8-9 months apart in between brief visits, and as our time apart progressed I was aware of new unhealthy habits forming (googling symptoms, anxiety induced nausea/chest pains/numbness/tingling/jaw pain). 

We are now married and have been living together for a year, and although I am happier than ever, all of my bad HA related habits have decided to make a home in my brain. I feel so unlike myself as I have never expeirenced anything quite like this before. I was so caught up with dealing with a long distance/international relationship that I didn't do anything to stop the progress of this anxiety and now it has become an integral part of my day to day life. Like many of you I experience chest pain, numbness, tightness, tingling, and nausea, and I have been to see my doctor on a few of these occasions, and have been told that I am fine. I have even been to the hospital (same results). Again, I know this is all very common for those suffering from HA. My added complication comes from my history of heart defect/heart surgery. I wish that I could just erase my knowledge of this event since it really exacerbates my HA and often sends me into a spiral. Although I know most of my chest pains are benign, the fact that I have had major surgery lends just a bit more credence to the HA voice telling me I'm dying, and this is destroying my mental and physical health. 

It doesn't help that I can't find any resources on living post-op from a pediatric heart surgery in your 20's/30's, and what to expect as you age. All of the materials I find online about what to expect after a heart surgery are clearly directed towards 55+ year olds, which is very alienating. I am always the youngest person in the cardiologist's office by several decades, and I've never met another person in my age group that has had open heart surgery. I've looked for support groups for young adults living post-op from CHD's, but I haven't been able to find anything. 

My question is this. Does anyone on here relate to my story/situation? Does anyone here have a history of CHD and open heart surgery? Since I can't find any information about this, my HA is telling me this is because they all died young and my time is limited, although I know this cannot be true. I just want to talk to someone about their experience with this and get support from people who know where I'm coming from. AH and CHD open heart surgery are an abundantly shitty combination and I know my current anxiety levels are unsustainable. I can't live like this. 

Even if you haven't had open heart surgery, any advice/resources would be welcome. I'm very overwhelmed and not sure how to deal with this.

34242,"Swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year I‘ve had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high (on weed) at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a full-blown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up, I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowed(mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex) i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, I cannot control it. I’ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now I‘ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how I swallow and  when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. I‘ve thought about hiatus hernia(the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus), GERD(but I‘ve never noticed any acidic reflux), and so on... It‘s gotten so bad that some nights I can‘t even sleep because I‘m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... I‘ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection(or something like that idk), the second one sent me to a therapist to whom I‘ll go to in march and the third one didn‘t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. It‘s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever I searched, I‘ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. I‘m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because I‘m not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough I‘m not laying down. When I lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? :(",Anxiety,swallowing air mostly laying back since start year really weird symptoms started suddenly noticed faint clicking noises back throat got scared high weed time since weed trigger paranoia sent full blown panic attack panic attack first started swallowing lot air due anxiety reflex sobering back normal stupid thought okay smoke weed next panic attack shaking feeling hearing air move stomach abdomen point quit smoking yet incident noticed whenever laid back swallowed mostly normal spit swallow reflex could hear feel tiny air bubbles travel esophagus happens absolutely subconsciously cannot control also noticed sometimes ears throat hurts become extremely aware breathe swallow feel hear something weird body led searching internet various reasons may happening thought hiatus hernia conditions diaphragm pushes stomach esophagus gerd never noticed acidic reflux gotten bad nights even sleep bad anxiety symptoms gone three different doctors first one completely ignored symptoms said bloating comes intestinal infection something like idk second one sent therapist go march third one find anything wtong like first one extremely hard live condition wherever searched found absolutely nothing actually led illness using simeticon relieve bloating able burp air may add burp lot subconcious air swallowing sometimes happens eventhough laying lay back though happens almost constant wondering anyone something similar,"လွင့်မျောနေသောအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုလှုပ်ခတ်ခဲ့သောကြောင့်အစာရှောင်ခြင်းအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုလှုပ်ခတ်ခဲ့သောအစာရှောင်ခြင်းအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုလှုပ်ခတ်ခဲ့သောအစာရှောင်ခြင်းအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုလှုပ်ခတ်ခဲ့သောအစာရှောင်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်နွေးထွေးသောအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုစတင်ခဲ့သည့်အစာရှောင်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်နွေးထွေးသောအငြင်းပွားမှုများကိုစတင်ခဲ့သည့်အစာရှောင်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်နွေးထွေးသောတိုက်ခိုက်မှုများကိုဖြတ်သန်းသွားသောကြောင့်နွေးထွေးသောအစာရှောင်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်ထိတ်လန့်ခြင်း Swallow Reflex Tiny Esophagus သည်အလွန်အမင်းမသန်စွမ်းသောအရာများကိုရှာဖွေခြင်းသည်အလွန်အမင်းစိတ်ဓာတ်ရှိသည့်အစာရှောင်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်မကောင်းသောအစာရှောင်ခြင်းများကိုတွေ့ရသည့်မကောင်းသောအစာဖတ်များသည်အလွန်အမင်းစိတ်ပျက်ဖွယ်ကောင်းသောအရာများ၌အ 0 ံငြ့် esprex သည်အလွန်အမင်းစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေသည်ကိုသတိပြုမိသည်။ Bloating သည် IDK ဒုတိယအကြိမ်ပို့ခြင်းကုထုံးကိုသုံးသောကုထုံးသုံးပုံတစ်ပုံကိုရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိသည့်မည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုအဘယ်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆိုမည်သည့်နေရာတွင်မဆို,"
34661,"I convinced myself that I have esophageal cancer. So I am 22 years old without any known digestive issues like GERD or anything. However for a couple of weeks now my stomach hurts like hell everytime I swallow something, like a cramp when the food is passing into it.

The last few month have probably been the most stressfull of my life so I had a lot of acid reflux issues which in turn can lead to only one logical conclusion that it hurts because my esophageal cancer is blocking most of the pipes and that I am going to die (/s).

The symptoms have gotten better over the last week now while I had vacation and only swallowing large portions causes the pain or when there is a lot of sauce on it. But that is a state I reached a few weeks back and it eventually retuned.

Anyone have some input here, because I know how much of a hassle it would be to get my doc to order a gastroscopy. So far he only gave me these acid absorbing pills or something like that but I am not sure that they helped all that much.

19705,I feel so hopeless and like a failureI do not know how to put this eloquently so I am just going to say it. This past year I applied to medical school (several different ones) and I got one interview which turned into a waitlist which I am still on. I feel like literally such a failure and I am burnt out and exhausted because I feel like I have worked so hard for four years just for my dreams that I have had for so long to be crushed. Sure I did not have the best grades or best MCAT score but it felt like it should have been enough. Now I am reapplying and I am just so burnt out I cannot even bring myself to work on the application because I feel like I have some sort of PTSD like thing? That just paralyzes me and prevents me from doing anything at all. I am also looking for a job to do for my gap year and it feels hopeless because I have not heard back from anywhere at all. I just feel so sad and hopeless and depressed I do not know what to do. I just recently graduated college and I just feel so lost and I do not know what comes next.

9026,"Honestly, not even sure what I want to say. Kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. Not post-partum depression. I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead.

35074,"Today's health anxiety level: shakily taking temperature with a meat thermometer because I couldn't find a human one Today I'd felt pretty okay honestly. Minus my usual stressed out-ness, a mini depressive episode, and being upset I slept in late, it'd be a pretty solid day!

&amp;#x200B;

That is, until the little voice in my head going ""hey you should google some symptoms, you know, its probably just a cold but just to be sure."" So I looked up the fact I've been experiencing flushing in my face, and decided that ""oh god it might be rosacea, oh god what if its cushings"" before calming down and saying its probably normal. I noticed it wasn't just face flushing, my whole body felt warm, so I must have a fever, right? It makes sense, as I've been fighting off a cold for a while now. but then just to completely fuck up my day, my brain thought of that little key word that can send me spiraling: sepsis. I looked up the symptoms for sepsis for the millionth time in my life. I took my pulse by hand and it was 100, I took it using two different apps and it was always above 90. That was one check off the list. I couldn't check my blood pressure because I couldn't go get the machine without alerting my family to my weird behavior, but I didn't think I felt like I had low blood pressure at the moment, but do I even know what that feels like? What if this is what it feels like? I switched immediately to the next test I could try, my temperature. I know I've felt my skin warm to the touch, but I'm naturally someone who gives off a lot of heat, but the heat on my face and neck felt abnormal but I needed to know *how* abnormal, so I tore up the areas where we keep health stuff that I *could* tear up discretely and found no human thermometers. It then hit me that we have meat thermometers! A quick google search didn't really say if they'd be effective for taking usual under-the-tongue temperatures but I'm sure it would work anyway. I cleaned off a thermometer and stood in the mirror with it under my tongue so I could see the display. The numbers slowly kept creeping upwards and the suspense was throwing me into a panic, that I *must* have sepsis, but how did I get it? Oh gosh it must be the canker sore I noticed on that one part of my gums that have been swollen for a bit, that's it its because I don't brush my teeth after every meal bacteria from my teeth got into my blood and now I have *sepsis* and I'm going to ***die****.* And then the thermometer eventually plateau'd somewhere around 95.4 or so. And now I'm somewhat calmer but I just can't help still feeling *weary*. Writing this all out here though has sorta helped me illustrate to myself how ridiculous it has been, which is much better than I've handled the fear of having sepsis in the past! So wooo to me :)

35487,"I've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. How do I get past this? Hey everyone, I'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety (since I was a little girl).

Recently though, I have been really sick - like since before Thanksgiving. I've had bronchitis, the Norovirus (ended up in hospital), tonsillitis, the flu, then the stomach flu again, and now I'm at home sick for a week because the cold I've had since early November never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. My throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.

But anyways, I was put on a really high antibiotic and Prednisone 3x a day, and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. I started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out, so I Googled (I want to punch myself lol) and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. Then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery, so I googled again (I rly need to stop) and it said that some people have experienced something called ""phantom vibrations"" or something like that. The thing is though, I'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and I've never paid it any attention.

I had a rly bad panic attack right after that, but I took a shower and calmed down and was fine. But today, my hip and leg have been aching, and I'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc I'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the Prednisone  making me feel this way.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Because I know it's probably nothing, but I've just had a rough time today with being worried about it And having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.

13577,"I am very sick and tired, both mentally and physically. I have been struggling with a lot of physical health issues for my whole life, and I have been struggling with mental health issues for the past 6-7 years, I am so tired of having to deal with both problems, as my physical health makes my mental health worse and the stress from my mental health is likely just making my conditions worse, its a never ending cycle and I rarely feel good, ever. I have been struggling with severe asthma for my whole life, which is fine on its own, but its at the point where I have a hard time doing much exercise, and I can no longer cope with weather changes, so every time it rains a lot of it becomes a bit more dry than normal I find myself heaving for air and coughing up blood. I am writing this right after contemplating taking my own life and coughing up more blood into my sink. My asthma is not all, I have a lot of trouble eating food, I randomly get very sick after eating and I cannot seem to link it to any specific type of food, so almost every day after eating a meal I am in pain for hours. I have a hard time sleeping, I have barely gotten any sleep the last few months, and when I do sleep I sleep almost the whole day, and I cannot get out of bed to do anything, its very frustrating. As for my mental health, I have not been able to seek any professional health for a lot of reasons, so whatever I say about my mental health is not diagnosed, but all I know is that I NEED to see a professional soon, I cannot handle my own thoughts anymore and it sucks. I have been struggling with really severe depression since I was about 11-ish, and the earliest suicide attempt I can remember was over the summer after I had completed 6th grade, I had not been eating for a few days and I was just extremely sad. I have had a few attempts before, usually I am too tired or scared to fully go through with it, which sometimes when I am having a good day I feel grateful for not going through with, but usually I just remember my past attempts and feel an overwhelming urge to try again. I also have really extreme anxiety, and it is exhausting. My anxiety is just crippling me and it kind of rules my life to a large degree, as I do not ever get close to many people, and I am too scared to just act how I want to act around peers and even friends. Speaking of, I do not ever speak to any of my friends outside of when I am physically around them, and I never see them on my own time simply because I have no energy to see anyone and I do not live near most of my friends, which is sad since I only have like a handful of people I would call friends, and I am not close to them by any means beyond friendly engagements. My experience with schooling also makes me extremely depressed constantly. When I was in middle school a few years back I was constantly bullied for a lot of things: my poor social skills, being nerdy and kind of awkward, being annoying, and acting ""like a fag"" (this particularly hurts now because I am gay). I would get my books thrown at me, people punched me and once there was a boy about twice my size who made remarks that he was going to rape and beat me up in the school bathroom, and then followed me around the school with his friends. I tried to do sports, I played football (my dad wanted me to try it out, I never liked sports at all anyways) and this made my have a mental breakdown every day we had a game, and when it was not game day, people would bully me in the locker room. The boy that threatened to hurt me in the school bathroom got paired with me to practice tackle drills, and instead of doing it how we were instructed, he would pick me up and slam me into the ground repeatedly, which was not how our coach told us to do it, and it hurt my back and made me shake and cry after practice. In high school, I joined the swim team, as I loved swimming and I was actually very good at it, and on top of that it was the only sport I was able to do without worsening my asthma, which was great. But the massive pressure I had on me to do well in an extremely competitive swim team made me constantly anxious, and I cannot even enjoy going to the pool anymore. I got picked on by my swim mates as well, because I was not very well socially adjusted, and I would get insulted in the locker room for being a little weird. Our soon to become team captain was kind to me and told me not to listen to them after school, but that really did not help much. My family is not really much better: my dad is never home so I do not even know him as much as I wish I could. My biological dad is somewhere in Europe, and he stopped even trying to talk to me anymore when I was 10 years old. My adopted dad is alright, but he is kind of cold and does not really show affection in a way that I understand, although I know he cares for me. My mom had a bad childhood, so she has a lot of problems that I have to step around constantly. I ask them to take me to a professional of some sort, and up until a few months ago they would just play down my mental issues and coupled with my really bad anxiety I was too anxious to actually say anything. I started telling them I had very frequent suicidal thoughts, and this I think really scared both my mom and dad and so they kind of lashed out, I do not think they know what to do. My dad told me that killing myself would be a selfish thing and I just told him to fuck off if that is what he wants to tell me, and my mom told me she would get me help but always is too busy/forgets to schedule me an appointment. I feel like I am trapped in a box and I am invisible to my own family most of the time. A few years ago I started having obtrusive thoughts that ranged from random urges to harm myself, many of which I acted on, to thoughts that my family secretly hates me. This past year was awful for me. I am an at risk group for Covid and the whole pandemic thing just took a massive toll on my already declining mental health. Being in my house was not bad for me thankfully, I am kind of used to being alone, but the frankly idiotic and terrible response to it by my local and national government made me a lot more nihilistic than I already was. I had a heavy school workload, I have always been considered ""gifted"" so most of my classes are pretty intensive and doing them online was terrible. I sacrificed my sleep for A's and B's and my dad still was not satisfied, which made our relationship even worse as I was so tired I just told him to shut up. My parents argue a lot as well, sometimes my dad yells at me for no reason and my mom yells at my dad, and it is almost constant. I have also lost faith in my parents being competent role caretakers in any way. They argue like children, and its almost always over me as well. I already lost one dad and I do not want to lose another, I wish I could fucking die in an accident so my family could stop having to argue, or pay for my medical treatment. I have little to no energy to do anything that could take my mind off of my problems either, I just lay in bed all day and zone out while watching YT videos that I do not really want to watch anyways. I am also worried my teachers think I am ""special"" or something, I cannot really engage in social situations that well and I think I might have autism, as some of my relatives have it and it would kind of explain my lack of social function. But my parents will not take me to see anyone anyways, so why should I even care? Sometimes I wonder if I am being neglected by family, I would consult my counselor but my anxiety stops me from really speaking to anyone about it because I am scared it will turn out my parents are abusing me mentally and I do not think they are bad people, they just have a lot of their own issues and they are frankly just silly people in their own right. I do not know what to do, I am kind of hoping that my health issues will just kill me already, I do not think I am going to get any better, my asthma is only getting worse to the point that my doctors are assessing if my lungs even work properly at all, and I also might need to get the inside of my stomach looked at because my doctors could not find out why my body freaks out whenever I eat, which scares me. I do not know if I am going to live a long life, and all I want is to have my problems go away. I hate where I live as well, I cannot stand it at all, and I cannot move currently due to a multitude of reasons. I want to just die already because living this way for almost a decade now has just destroyed me as a person, I feel sick inside and I have no one to really talk to about it, I have some online friends who are very kind to me, but I get panic attacks and I feel extremely ill whenever I open up about my issues to someone I know. I do not know what to do, I keep remembering instances where I attempted suicide and its overwhelming me all the time. I cannot even use sleep as an escape. I hate my life.

17476,"So I am a big old ball of horrible right now and really do not know where to turn. do not have many friends who can understand how to be there or just get awkward, and for the veryyyy few people (like 2) its still a challenge to really go into how I feel.Basically I have been depressed my whole life and had a complete crash about 10 years ago trying to OD and handing in the ICU. For this whole ten years I have tried tons and tonsss of medications. Nothing worked, if it worked it worked a little, and sometimes would even be on 6 different medications. Also since then, been In therapy, been to the psych ward a fair amount and even got to the point my psychiatrist at the time was thinking electroshock therapy. I am so unable to function and impacted by + other aspects health (that i will not fully get into) that I classify as disabled and get Medicare. This past. Half of a year has just been kicking my but more and more every day and its getting so exhausting. I am in the only medications I can even take (Wellbutrin and lamotrigine) and even though it helps some. Say 10% it hardly gets me by. 90% percent of the medications I have tried do not work, work some and send me to the hospital at the same time. I cannot tell you howMany times I have been to the hospital honestly from just medications alone. All of this has built up to absolutely new lows in my life. I do not think I have ever been this bad I have tried my best for the past half year but its been slowly building up takes me 5 hours or all day to get out of bed, I cannot function anymore, I want to die everyday, I have no energy, my brain is so fried from it I can do subjects I am passionate about not just from lack of motivation but lack of being able to read. Yes, its gotten so bad I cannot read. My brain just shuts down. After it got really close to a huge tipping point where I was so close to just ending it all that my psych thought we urgently needed to do something and I told him I did not really care anymore and although it scared me we both agreed to one of the very few I have not tried: Paxil. 4 days later find my self in the ER with bradycardia and blood sugar levels so low that I almost went into a coma. The ER doctor told me to stop the medication immediately and for the next 4 days I could hardly walk and needed a cane everywhere I wentSo. I feel pretty damn hopeless. My psych, my cardiologist, my gp and my neurologist do not want me touching any psych meds besides the ones I am on. But they help so little and I am just shutting down so so hard. there is just nothing I can do, no meds to take, nothing in life that made me happy and the one thing that did make my life shine for once is gone :/ . I mean even during those moments of course depression was a thing but I was actually happy now I just lay in a dark room, rolled into a ball in the corner of my bed, been spending money I do not have, watching TV or having it in the back round i do not eat to the point my stomach feels like its being ripped from hunger pains, I cannot pay attention to anything anyone says, I have no ability to even have sex if I wanted to (but frustrated because mentally I have drive so it can make me irritable. But I am a lone so no chance of that.I am tellin you all I just see no hope. there is so many things I want to do rock climb.. read learn hike but no matter how badly I want to do it I just cantPoint being is I am in a super dark place, even darker before I tried to OD. Its been at this level for so long now I even started drinking which is something I never thought Id do. I do not drink to experience being drunk, I drink for the soul reason to get so drunk As fast as possible to pass out since it gets worse at nights when I try to sleep. This started after being at the breaking point for so long I tried to OD a month ago.I need help but there is no help to begin with. I feel like I need therapy everyday just to get by and not just once a weeks.Anyway that is only the half of it and I know this is long and I am sorry for that just feel so hopeless I do not know where to turn and where to get support there is literally no point even having appointments with a psychiatrist. You know how hopeless that makes me feel? Anyway Thanks for reading and sorry its so long. No energy to proof read, sorry. Just need to rant, some support and feel pretty hopeless especially after Paxil almost killed me.

20058,"I am 31 and have severe post acute withdrawal syndrome from Cymbalta. After being on suicide watch and given toxic psychiatric drugs for many, many years my brain, nervous system, and body are permanently damaged and recovery is impossible. Thanks to Big Pharma, psychiatry, and the system which is killing us all I am in a state of unimaginable suffering 247, bedridden a lot of the time, sick, with heart palpitations, dizziness, ringing in my ears, muscle spasms, brain zaps, headaches, spotty vision, nausea, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, akathesia, brain fog, insomnia, psychosis, nightmares, sweating, hot and cold, etc the symptoms go on and on. I am already in a support group for this and I am not tapering my dose anymore. But regardless of that there is nothing further that can be done to improve my situation. Recently I went to the dentist to get a cracked filling replaced and she told me the mercury in the new filling could not get into my body. But that is not true. She used improper extraction methods and did not protect me from the toxins she drilled out of the old tooth, and now I am sick with mercury poisoning as well. I am such an idiot and should know not to trust any doctors anymore. I should have done my research before. But I was dumb and listened to this idiot. Now I am sicker in pain and I want to kill my self. My gf is sleeping and for me I think I would like to go jump off a bridge. I researched it before and it seems like one of the better options. My entire life has been hell but since March I have been getting sicker and sicker and have been in a new level of hell I cannot deal with any longer. My parents try to help but they are dumb idiots who keep trusting the system and do not understand that its killing me and killing us all. They are dumb and I tried to stick around for them but a lot of times I hate them. My brother killed himself 2 years ago but they do not understand that it was a suicide. He did drugs and got possessed by demons. I know because I have spoken to him. People think I am lucky because my parents and gf always stop me from killing myself but really I just want to die. But since my experience with my brother I do worry about going to purgatory. No I did not think it was real either. But sadly it is and the death does not even bring any relief. But I want to do it anyway. Anything to get away from this never ending hell. I have tried everything already to feel better but nothing works. I am in hell forever. My family needs to let me go but they do not understand. I feel no one understands the pain I am in. I am also scared to do it so I hope I will die suddenly by accident. Like a giant meteor come down and strike this awful place. I know what caused this but for me its too late now. Brain damage permanent I cannot think or get out of hell.

20841,"I live out in the country, there is a forest fire really close to my place. About an hour ago I called 911 to tell them about it. They said that they were aware of the situation, told me what to do if I needed to evacuate, and then told me to listen to the news for updates.Next thing I did is I called the suicide hotline because I have already been seriously thinking I need to kill myself over the last few days because of a million shitty things in my life that are all catching up right now, and if I have to evacuate my home and let it burn to the ground then I am probably going to kill myself tonight or tomorrow.I started to talk to the operator on the line and tell her this. She interrupts me and tells me that this line is being recorded, and that if its a prank call she will report me to the police and that its a felony. I tell her its not and try to keep taking to her. She says that I should call 911, that I should listen to the news for updates, and then says that she has a record that I have called there before (once before this year, four times in the last year), and then she hung up.This is the last time I am ever going to call a hotline. I have already felt bad every time I have called because I know there are other people who need it more then me, but this is proof to me that my problems are not worth there time and I have been wasting their resources, which makes me feel like killing myself worse. I am really fucking hurt that she thought I was prank calling. I have just started therapy a week ago but it has not helped me yet and I am still ready to kill myself, because its not like one session can magically make someone not suicidal, especially when the therapist I saw spent our whole first session making me fill out paperwork instead of helping me right away. These guys say that they will be there for you when you cannot reach or do not have access to therapy and counseling, which I have not every time I have called. Lies through teeth.I am sorry that I am angry. I know that these lines have helped a lot of people, and that these are volunteers trying to help, and that this is a good service and because. I guess I am just hurt and bitter that I do not count to it anymore as stupid as that sounds. I am sorry.I know that most of the shit they say is fake empathy but the last times I called I let myself pretend that they actually could care and help because it kept me from shooting myself. The illusion is broken now, I know its fucking stupid and petty to be so angry and hurt about something I deep down knew was fake but here I am.

In my high school years I have mostly sat in my room, playing games with close friends. Only drinking with them, never really went out to pubs or bigger parties. I was never in love and kissed only one girl who was a really great friend of mine and we decided we want to be each others first. For a few months we were like a couple but we definitely were not in love. Fast forward to university. I decided to become more socialized and played less video games, went to uni parties, etc. I have kissed quite a few girls and had some makeouts (sex) with some of them. I even had two girlfriends but both were casual and I was not really in love. My last relationship ended a few months ago. And now uni over, started working, having a good job but lack of friends because I moved to a new town and only know a few people here.It started hitting me in the past weeks that I never had a true first love in high school or uni. I never had a successfull date where I kissed a girl. I honestly never experienced TRUE love. I met ALL the girls in my past years at parties or pubs and had something between us because either we were drunk or the girl was into me.And it makes sad that I am almost 24 years old and my youth is kind of over.

35049,"Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys, my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain.   


The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking ""comfort"" (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek ""discomfort"" and that led me to what I now understand as ""rewilding"".   


Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol.   


Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.   


If anyone is interested in more information on this, I'll happily write an article, but I'm not an expert, just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/).   


But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.   


Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out, and it started with seeking discomfort, learning some stoicism, and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too.

22898,"A few months ago, I would be making yet another post on this subreddit. I was at my lowest. To get to that point of my life, the point of my life where I literally wanted to end it, I had years of social isolation, an adolescence scarred and stolen from me by bullying that left me with PTSD and being too scared to leave my own fucking house, being diagnosed with aspergers and depression, put on medication and coming literally to the edge of life and death. And you know what? I survived. I am a survivor. I have come to the realisation that there literally is nothing left in life that can frighten me. No height too high. No space too small. No flight too bumpy. No bully too big. I fear nothing, but fear itself. The thing that has scared me the most? My emotions. Being so traumatised, so low that I felt I had nothing to live for. Has anything changed? Not really. I still have no friends. I am still a confused, screwed up teen (well young adult I am 18 now), who'se still yet to experience anything you would expect from someone that age, still unemployed and still just as restless as ever. But what has changed? I embraced the mindset of a survivor. I stopped viewing myself as a victim. That is not to say I am a victim. I have been treated horiffically, an outcast by the society around me for my entire adolesence. But if I can survive years of loneliness, being bullied relentless for months on end, effectively imprisoned for fear of being attacked when I went out, night upon night of waking up in pools of sweat reliving the terror I experienced or might experience in the future, being on the edge of life and death, I can survive anything. This is the only positive thing I have posted on here. Probably one of the few positive things on here. My advice? Stop reading or posting on this subreddit until you are in a better place. it is filled with very angry, very desperate and sad people like how I was (and let us face it, I still have days like that), wallowing in an echo chamber where their worthlessness is projected to thousands of other like-minded people who believe that they too are equally worthless. If things have got that bad in your life that you thought about ending it, and you did not, then you are a survivor too. everyone is pain tolerance threshold is different, and if you did not give into that voice that told you you were better of dead, you have survived.

When it is just me here I look around and it is like my loneliness is hitting me in the face. Right now I am struggling because I have been separated with my son's mother because we had issues. Even so, I love her so much and being apart kills me inside. We have been separated for a while but we at least still talked and hung out. We had a fight and ever since then we have not been right. I want to be with her but she said she is not sure what she wants but is certain that she does not want a relationship at this moment. I totally understand that and do not want to force anything but it is hard going to like zero interaction with her and then the small amounts of time I do see her when she picks up our son or I drop him off. A few times in my life I have thought about killing myself and luckily always got through. I am trying hard to stay on the positive side but lately thoughts creep into my head about doing it again. I will look around to see what could support my weight to hang myself, I think about doing the running car in the garage thing, or even just buying a gun. I end up shaking my head and brushing those thoughts away but they are becoming more frequent and I am just scared that the amount of time that I have alone with myself that one time I will not brush it aside.

16267,"Obviously, loss of interest/pleasure in once-enjoyable activities is a huge part of depression. In fact, it is one of the hallmark signs that doctors look for when searching for a diagnosis. What I am asking about today is similar to that aspect of the major suck-fest that is living with depression, but a little bit different. What happens to me is that I suddenly feel like doing something that I usually enjoy is actually making me feel MORE depressed. Now, when I say suddenly, I do not mean in a relatively short period of time, like over the course of a couple of days, or even hours or minutes, I mean SUDDENLY. Instantaneously. I will give an example scenario here, because I am not sure how else to really give a clear explanation of this stupidity. Okay, so, I love interior design, I have since I was a child. I love every aspect of it. I love creating floor plans and perspective drawings, I love making presentation boards with every last detail represented, I love watching interior design shows, I love garnering inspiration and learning how to use new design methods and techniques, and I LOVE going to home decor and furniture stores. Even if I am not buying or even looking for anything in particular, I can spend literal hours just combing every aisle. it is my kid in a candy shop setting, 100%. So a couple of days ago, I had some errands to run, and I decided to stop by HomeGoods while I was out, just to poke around. If I am not feeling well, giving myself a field trip to a good home dcor spot will usually have me feeling like myself again in a jiffy. I got ready and left the house feeling relatively upbeat and excited for my upcoming treat. I ran around and got my errands done first, to avoid feeling like I would had dessert without finishing my vegetables. Feeling like I earned whatever treat I give myself, and knowing I do not have anything else I should be doing instead, makes it 100x more enjoyable. I parked the car, hopped out, and pretty much frolicked through the front door like a big old goofball, heading straight to the bathroom department in search of a new shower curtain, because I actually do need one for my downstairs bathroom. As soon as I stopped in front of the display, though, I felt an extremely dramatic shift in my disposition. Just a few seconds ago, I had been really happy, in my zone. Suddenly, though, staring at all the pretty shower curtains felt like the last thing in the whole world I wanted to do. All I could think was, This is stupid. Why am I even here? I turned a slow circle, scanning the rest of the store to see if I could spot anything that might reignite my vigor of a few moments earlier. The more I saw, though, the more bleak and dismal everything seemed. It felt as though a black mist had descended, surrounding me, as well as filling me with a bitter, defeated, heavy sadness. I took a couple of deep, stabilizing breaths, but they did not help. My eyes began to sting, and I knew I had to get out of there before I started inexplicably bawling in front of a store full of people. Feeling as though I had just lost something intangible but meaningful, I slowly and dejectedly made my way out of the store with my eyes trained on the floor. This is typically how this phenomenon usually plays out for me, though it sometimes happens in other ways, as well. Sometimes I will feel great while I shower, dress, and do my hair and makeup, but as soon as I am all ready to go, I do not feel like doing whatever it was anymore. Like I said before, it actually feels like the absolute last thing I want to do. Sometimes it happens right away, as soon as I think of something I want to do. I will think, I would really like to go take pictures in the woods, and start to get excited by the idea, but then, in a fraction of a second, that excitement is replaced by a crushing sadness in response to the same idea. So, yeah, the best way I can explain it is just that something I normally love to do gets flipped upside down in my mind, and my beloved activity now feels like it is actually a part of the problem. It begins to feel like a source of depression and anxiety. To the extent that, if someone asked me, what is causing you to feel unhappy right now? I would reply, the thought of doing something I absolutely love, that is what is making me feel shitty right now. I do not understand why this happens to me, but I am so sick of it. I am just so indescribably tired of the things I usually use to help myself feel better begin to only make me feel worse. it is so mean of my brain to do this to me, and I cannot seem to find a way to make it stop. In fact, it just happens more and more often as time goes by. Does anyone else experience this, or anything like it? If so, what have you done about it? Also, does anyone have a medical or scientific explanation for why this happens? This Suddenly Sucks",Depression,obviously loss interest pleasure enjoyable activities huge part depression fact one hallmark signs doctors look searching diagnosis asking today similar aspect major suck fest living depression little bit different happens suddenly feel like something usually enjoy actually making feel depressed say suddenly mean relatively short period time like course couple days even hours minutes mean suddenly instantaneously give example scenario sure else really give clear explanation stupidity okay love interior design since child love every aspect love creating floor plans perspective drawings love making presentation boards every last detail represented love watching interior design shows love garnering inspiration learning use new design methods techniques love going home decor furniture stores even buying even looking anything particular spend literal hours combing every aisle kid candy shop setting couple days ago errands run decided stop homegoods poke around feeling well giving field trip good home dcor spot usually feeling like jiffy got ready left house feeling relatively upbeat excited upcoming treat ran around got errands done first avoid feeling like would dessert without finishing vegetables feeling like earned whatever treat give knowing anything else instead makes x enjoyable parked car hopped pretty much frolicked front door like big old goofball heading straight bathroom department search new shower curtain actually need one downstairs bathroom soon stopped front display though felt extremely dramatic shift disposition seconds ago really happy zone suddenly though staring pretty shower curtains felt like last thing whole world wanted could think stupid even turned slow circle scanning rest store see could spot anything might reignite vigor moments earlier saw though bleak dismal everything seemed felt though black mist descended surrounding well filling bitter defeated heavy sadness took couple deep stabilizing breaths help eyes began sting knew get started inexplicably bawling front store full people feeling though lost something intangible meaningful slowly dejectedly made way store eyes trained floor typically phenomenon usually plays though sometimes happens ways well sometimes feel great shower dress hair makeup soon ready go feel like whatever anymore like said actually feels like absolute last thing want sometimes happens right away soon think something want think would really like go take pictures woods start get excited idea fraction second excitement replaced crushing sadness response idea yeah best way explain something normally love gets flipped upside mind beloved activity feels like actually part problem begins feel like source depression anxiety extent someone asked causing feel unhappy right would reply thought something absolutely love making feel shitty right understand happens sick indescribably tired things usually use help feel better begin make feel worse mean brain cannot seem find way make stop fact happens often time goes anyone else experience anything like done also anyone medical scientific explanation happens suddenly sucks,"သိသာထင်ရှားတဲ့ဆုံးရှုံးမှုစိတ် 0 င်စားစရာကောင်းလောက်အောင်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျမှုတွေဟာတကယ်တမ်းကျတဲ့ဇာတ်လမ်းတွဲမှာပဲစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့အရာကနည်းနည်းလေးပဲလို့ပြောရရင်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျမှုတွေကတော်တော်လေးကွဲပြားတဲ့အရာကမတူတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ကျရောဂါဖြစ်နေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျတာကိုကြည့်ရတာ, ချစ်ခြင်းမေတ္တာကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်း၏နောက်ဆုံးအသေးစိတ်အချက်အလက်များသည်ချစ်ခြင်းမေတ္တာကိုကြည့်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်ချစ်ခြင်းမေတ္တာကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်းပင်မစာမျက်နှာကိုကြည့်ခြင်းအားဖြင့်လှည့်ပတ်နေသည့်အိမ်တွင်း၌ပင်ပန်းနွမ်းနယ်နေသောအိမ်တွင်းတွင်ကောင်းမွန်သောအိမ်တွင်းတွင် 0 ယ်ခြင်းများပြုလုပ်သောအရာ 0 မ်းသာသောအိမ်တွင်း၌ပင်ပန်းနွမ်းနယ်နေသောအိမ်တွင်းတွင်ကောင်းမွန်သောအိမ်တွင်း၌ပင်ပန်းနွမ်းနယ်နေသောနေရာတိုင်းတွင်ကောင်းမွန်သောအိမ်တွင်းတွင် 0 ယ်ခြင်းများကိုနှစ်သက်ဖွယ်ကောင်းသောအိမ်တွင်းတွင် 0 ယ်ယူခြင်းသည်အလွန်ကောင်းမွန်သောအိမ်တွင်းတွင် 0 ယ်ယူခြင်းကိုနှစ်သက်သည်။ X ကိုနှစ်သက်သောယာဉ်ရပ်နားသောကားတစ်စီးကိုရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိသည့်အိမ်တံခါးကိုရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိသည့်အိမ်တံခါးကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်းကဲ့သို့စားသောက်ဆိုင်များကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်းကဲ့သို့သောပျော်ရွှင်ဖွယ်ရာနေရာကိုကြည့်ရှုရန်လိုသောရေချိုးခန်းတံခါးကိုကြည့်ရှုနိုင်သည့်အိမ်တံခါးကိုရှာဖွေတွေ့ရှိခဲ့သော်လည်းအလွန်အံ့အားသင့်စရာကောင်းသောနေရာကိုကြည့်ရှုခြင်းခံရသည်။ အစောပိုင်းကစိတ်ပျက်ဖွယ်ကောင်းသော 0 မ်းနည်းပူဆွေးမှုအ 0 တ်အထည်များအ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်နေသည့်နက်ရှိုင်းသောအခိုးအရင့်ဆုံးသောစိတ်ဖိစီးမှုများပြုလုပ်နိုင်သည့်နက်ရှိုင်းစွာအဓိပ္ပာယ်ရှိသည့်နက်ရှိုင်းစွာအဓိပ္ပာယ်ရှိကြောင်းခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ တကယ်တော့တကယ်တော့ဒီလိုမျိုးဖြစ်ချင်တဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျမှုတွေဟာစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျမှုတွေကတကယ့်ကိုစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျစေချင်တဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်တွေကတဖြည်းဖြည်းချင်းချစ်မြတ်နိုးတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့ပုံရိပ်တွေကတကယ်တော့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျမှုတစ်ခုကပြန်ပြောပြတယ်။ များသောအားဖြင့်ပင်ပန်းစွာပင်ပန်းစွာပင်ပန်းစွာအသုံးပြုလေ့ရှိသောအရာများသည်ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သောအစပြုခြင်းကိုပိုမိုဆိုးရှားလာသည်ဟုခံစားရပါ။"

7855,"So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really, finally worked. I have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and C-PTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much, I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life.

16098,"On July 2 I had my first hosted birthday since maybe the age of 6 or 8. I was gifted 700 dollars worth of money and two book cases. I felt awful accepting all the money but deep down I really wanted it. The reason being I wanted to spend it all on pretty things.This past month of July I have been browsing at things to buy online, things that can help fill up the book cases. But before July, June, I was feeling depressed and had suicidal thoughts, and I have had those thoughts and feelings since I can recall, maybe the last five months but more noticeably, the last three. Anyway, the point is that this past month I have been buying things, getting attached to thing that I have not yet bought, only to want to buy them. Since I have the money I have seen it as an easy thing to do. The problem is that I have noticed that ever since I started buying things I have not had any suicidal thoughts. Which I see as a good thing? I am happy?I find it fucked up how buying things is all I can think about, just the other day I watched the mailman get off and on the truck and drive away just to grab the box they left. Its like my life revolves around it. Two days ago i really wanted to buy things worth over 140 dollars, my mom said no, not knowing I had spent 200 dollars prior. She said that I should be spending the money on clothes and stuff that I need. Ever since then I have been sulking about it, wanting so badly to buy more things. And things I want to buy are useless and are only for display purposes besides some books. I tell myself that its my birthday money, and that I can help myself with spending it on whatever I want. And in reality I know deep down that I should not be buying these things? I hate falling for consumerism and basically numbing myself with all these things I want to buy and put in my room. I do not see it as an addiction but more of an escape. I might be delusional and maybe I was never depressed, but if these suicidal thoughts come back what do I do then.

34299,"Distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

I was alone and in desperation i changed who I was to fit in with the people around me I started taking drugs,acting out like they would. This led to me being labeled as a mess and a druggie.After eventually seeing my relationship with my dad for what it was we fell out and because he is incapable of accepting responsibility he told people lies about me which caused the few people I was close with to stop talking to me.After a lot of years me and my mum slowly started sorting out relationship out but she in a state of depression took a overdose while I was at the home, she walked up to me and told me she had taken a overdose and if I loved her I would sit and cuddle with her.I called the ambulance and helped her into the ambulance that was the last time I saw her alive.At 26 I finally came out as transgender and lost the few friends I had made since adulthood I was still hated by anyone who knew my mum or dad.Since I came out as transgender my sister stopped talking to me and stopped me seeing her children because of ""what I might do to them"" the people around where I live went from talking to me to slowly acting horrible to me and eventually calling me names.Now I am 33 I am just tired I thought things would get easier.I have had problems with dizziness for years now and the doctors keep palming me off when before I transitioned they would always be helpful my vision is messing up I have issues with the shape of my corenas but I do not have enough money to do anything about it.I recently got back InTouch with my dad and I thought I would message his step daughter to make sure things were ok with us and that she was s ok calling me by my name and can accept that he is my dad too (she had said she could not call me by my new name and laughed at me in the past) I explained that I have always been good to her and there is no reason she should be horrible to me. I then got messages saying it was my dead mums fault and lots of other nonsense all I wanted was for his stepdaughter to call me by my name you know respect me?

35401,"Afraid of hospital infection Well, I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection; however, if we look at the stats, hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery, the procedure just needs two 4-8 mm incisions basically. Usually, patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However, I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before, but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller(6""4') and 100 pounds heavier now(300lbs currently). I mean when we put all those things together, these make me anxious. To sum up:
I am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.
I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.
What are your thoughts?

It all started about 1 - 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh, and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat, my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later, ""ALS"" is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 - 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to ""test my strength"" in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee, the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. 

I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn.

35813,"Woo! Heart Woes. I’ve been dealing with bad heart palpitations since I was about 12 years old; my parents always told me it was anxiety attacks, as they run in the family.
In early February I had a bad anxiety attack with palpitations, which triggered about a 3 week period of time where my heart was just fluttering constantly, while I was laying in bed, trying to sleep, doing nothing, etc... I seriously felt like I was going to die, which then triggered a super intense depression like I’d never felt in my life. I finally gave in and went into Urgent Care once I had enough, where the doctor did an EKG and measured my resting heart rate at about 136 bpm. They urged me to go to emergency, so I did, and $1,000+ later they told me I was totally fine, my heart likes to jump around a lot but palpitations are normal and they recommended I start meditating. I don’t doubt the constant fluttering was probably due to health anxiety since I felt so scared from it. I took their advice, started meditating, got a breathing app, and decided to find a heart rate app to measure my bpm when it happens, since I’m never able to get into emergency when the palpitations are actually happening. It’s been giving me a little peace of mind to see what’s going on when I feel them and sometimes it’s not so bad as I feel like it is, my heart rate is usually 90-110 bpm, seems okay enough. It also helps me just to have a visual of whats going on. Anyway, after a couple more weeks of meditating, drinking lots of water and pulling myself out of my funk, I seemed alright again and convinced myself it’s all in my head.

Today I was shopping, bent over to pick something up, and it triggered really intense palpitations. My heart was pounding so hard that my entire body was shaking. I kept trying to calm down but had no luck- I remembered the heart rate app and pulled it out to see the severity of the situation. The app couldn’t even measure it for a minute, I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm, and so I sat and tried to calm down some more, and it finally slowed to about 160bpm, then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range. Now its been a couple hours and I’m comfortable in the 90’s. I’m super tired now but I feel like I handled it like a champ this time. It’s weird to experience a feeling like your heart is going to blow up but to have doctors tell you you’re fine. What a fun time :) Anyway, my sister says she knows of a cardiologist, I’m going to see if they’re accepting patients. I doubt I’ll get in anytime soon, since all the doctors in my area are booked out for months, but it is what it is I guess. Reading posts on this page and how other people deal with it has really helped me through all of this, so thank you everyone who’s shared their heart related stories! I don’t feel like there’s any advice I haven’t tried yet, but I still wanted to share my experience and get it off my chest!",Anxiety,woo heart woes dealing bad heart palpitations since years old parents always told anxiety attacks run family early february bad anxiety attack palpitations triggered week period time heart fluttering constantly laying bed trying sleep nothing etc seriously felt like going die triggered super intense depression like never felt life finally gave went urgent care enough doctor ekg measured resting heart rate bpm urged go emergency later told totally fine heart likes jump around lot palpitations normal recommended start meditating doubt constant fluttering probably due health anxiety since felt scared took advice started meditating got breathing app decided find heart rate app measure bpm happens since never able get emergency palpitations actually happening giving little peace mind see going feel sometimes bad feel like heart rate usually bpm seems okay enough also helps visual whats going anyway couple weeks meditating drinking lots water pulling funk seemed alright convinced head today shopping bent pick something triggered really intense palpitations heart pounding hard entire body shaking kept trying calm luck remembered heart rate app pulled see severity situation app even measure minute watched lines squiggling place extremely tiny bouncing everywhere finally got reading bpm sat tried calm finally slowed bpm minutes later back low range couple hours comfortable super tired feel like handled like champ time weird experience feeling like heart going blow doctors tell fine fun time anyway sister says knows cardiologist going see accepting patients doubt get anytime soon since doctors area booked months guess reading posts page people deal really helped thank everyone shared heart related stories feel like advice tried yet still wanted share experience get chest,"ဝမ်းနည်းပူဆွေးနေတဲ့အချိန်ကကလေးငယ်တွေရဲ့စိတ်မကောင်းစရာတွေကိုမိဘတွေကပြောပြီးကတည်းကစိတ်မကောင်းပါဘူးနှလုံးသားနက်နေထွက်နေတဲ့အတွက်စိတ်မကောင်းစရာတွေကအသည်းအသန်အိပ်ပျော်နေတဲ့အရာမှာစိတ်မကောင်းစရာစိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျနေတဲ့ Depary Deping Deping Deping Deal Deps သည်အစပြုခဲ့ခြင်းနှင့် ပတ်သက်. အိပ်မပျော်ပါ။ တွေးတောဆင်ခြင်ခြင်းသည်သံသယဖြစ်ဖွယ်ရှိသောအကြံဥာဏ်များကိုတွေးတောဆင်ခြင်ခြင်းသည်စိတ်ဓာတ်ကျခြင်းကိုရခြင်းအနေဖြင့်, နှလုံးခုန်ခြင်းကိုလှုပ်ခါနေသောနှလုံးခုန်ခြင်းကိုကြည့်ရှုရန်အလွန်သေးငယ်သောစိတ်အေးအေးဆေးဆေးနေသည့်အနေဖြင့်စိတ်အေးအေးဆေးဆေးနေသည့်အနေဖြင့်အလွန်သေးငယ်သောစိတ်အေးအေးဆေးဆေးနေသည့်အလိုတွင်ကြာမြင့်စွာကတည်းကစိတ်အေးအေးဆေးဆေးနေသည့်အလိုတွင်အလွန်သေးငယ်သောစိတ်အေးအေးဆေးဆေးခံစားခဲ့ရသည်။ ဆရာဝန်များကြိုတင်ဘွတ်ကင်များကြိုတင်ဘွတ်ကင်များကြိုတင်ဘွတ်ကင် Mearnings ူမန်မိာိုံင်ငံ,"

I had a salivary stone under my tongue a couple years ago causing my salivary glands to swell huge when I would eat. I guess its rare. I had it removed and since then I have some sort of nerve damage on the ""front"" of my neck. like my throat, but the outside and down to collar bone.So I had to leave my manual labor job and get a sit down security job. I started learning to program cuz my job is pointless and easy so I have free time.I moved back into my parents house. Nothing interests me anymore. Not even trying to turn anything around. I have friends but they are all succesful and own homes and are married having babies. So even when we hangout, although I am very happy for them, I inevitably drive back home, lonely, feeling like I have totally been left in the dust. Which is no ones fault, it just seems to be reality. gaming, music, movies, drawing- all things i used to love doing on my alone time- literally bore me to the point it makes me sad, so I do not even try anymore cuz it just makes me miss the old me. I love my family, but they are all very narcisistic(spelling). And my dad and mom both have health problems of their own. I really do not have anything to complain about compared to them, and they gave me a good childhood other than some abusive episodes. But they had very shitty childhoods.I just sit here and think about the past, the good days. Just , me being happy to be me.

24324,"You know, I wake up in the mornings and look at the world and the people in it and wonder, ""what is happened to the world? what is happened to all of us?"" there is no more love, kindness, caring, compassion, friendship, humanity, or humility anymore.We spend most of our hours, days, weeks, and months on social media - lying about how great our lives are, knowing full well that we are lying. However, we do it, to be mean, to be spiteful and cruel to those who have horrible lives. We spend our time on social media hating and ridiculing people because they are vaccinated or unvaccinated, hating and ridiculing people because they are black or because they are white or Jewish, Muslim, Asian, or any skin color that is not our own.We do not even talk to people outside of our computers anymore. No more, ""good morning,"" ""good evening,"" or ""hello."" We barely even communicate with people on social media, because we have been brainwashed to believe that if we do not know them why talk to them? Yet 9/11 comes around and we are all ""so connected as brothers and sisters?"" No, we are not. This entire world is so divided. How do we ever get to know people, learn about their background, their experiences, how do we get to make people our brothers and sisters, no matter if we know them or not if we stay confined to living our lives only communicating with people whom we see in our own daily lives? You wake up in the mornings and the news is just filled with stories of hate, crime, and violence. New York, which used to be one of the most beautiful states in America has now been turned into a violent Mad Max type of state. California is cluttered with homeless people whom no one, absolutely no one in California gives a damn about. The good homeless are being lumped together with mentally ill people and thus are being treated like garbage, right here on American soil, and no one bats an eye, no one cares. We have vaccinated people holding parties and living life totally separate from the unvaccinated - all because we have been told that the unvaccinated are toxic, and should be avoided, without us realizing that that is a lie that is being told to keep US divided from each other, because we are all stronger together, but no, there is a division in this world, between men and women, race against race, rich/wealthy/better off and the poor and homeless, between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. We hear stories of young people, and adults committing suicide and we say things like, ""oh that is sad, I feel sorry for the family,"" but do we REALLY mean it? If that person who committed suicide had came to you, just for words of encouragement or a virtual hug before they ended their lives, would you have been there for them? No, because you do not know them, so it is not your problem. However, when someone dies by their own hand, it IS our problem, because if they die because they cannot find peace, joy or happiness here on this Earth, it is our responsibility to help them. Contrary to popular belief, every person alive is our responsibility, because outside of this simulated world we call Earth, we ARE all related. We just do not realize it here because we have been so brainwashed to not realize this truth. This world is nothing like it used to be, in the '50s and '60s, and yes,, those times had bad times too, yes, but for the most part, for the absolute most part, those times were beautiful, because there was no social media, there was just people being there for people, not FAMILIES being there for families, not FRIENDS being there for friends, not BLACKS being there for blacks or WHITES being there for whites. It was just PEOPLE being there for people - mentally and emotionally. Every child was someone else's child as well. People would walk down the street and greet each other with, ""hey, brother,"" ""hey, sister,"" and they MEANT it. Do that today and people will think you have lost your mind. Humanity is gone and for those who say, ""no it is not, look at the many missionaries who are feeding and helping the poor in these countries."" Yeah, in those countries, but what about right here on American soil? What about in the UK and in countries where extreme hunger and poverty are not a problem? Humanity is gone.I want the world of the '50s and '60s back, where people could go to sleep all night and not lock their doors - and would wake up, safe and sound the next morning. I want the world of the '50s and '60s, back where you could go outside and see kids playing in the streets, instead of inside their homes, playing mindless video games. I want the world of the '50s and '60s back where blacks would look at whites as their brothers and sisters and whites would do the same toward blacks. I want the world of the '50s and '60s back where music had actual meaningful messages to them, where men were gentlemen and women were LADIES. I want the world of the '50s and '60s back, I or anyone else could make instant, lifelong friends with people whom we never knew before. I want the '50s and '60s back, where everyone was concerned about others' welfare, their livelihood, their mental state. However....I and the few people, the very, few people who feel like me, we know we will never have those days back, because the further we all drift into years, the more we turn from being humans into being mindless, uncaring robots with no emotion, no care, no concern, no - anything that even remotely resembles humanity and that even remotely resembles how we all should be towards each other; And this is why, a lot of days, I wake up, not even wanting to even be on this planet anymore. I do not even recognize this world anymore. The hate, the disconnect that we have towards each other, the violence, the coldness have turned this world into one that is completely foreign to me. However, this is the world that we are all in. And for many, many years, sadly, this is the world I have known.

I am always seeking opportunities, always trying to learn more about the newer demands of my job, and still, no one wants to hire me. I look around and all I see is my friends from college getting their first jobs in the area, gaining experience, doing amazing stuff and I am proud of them, but I am also extremely jealous. I want to grow, I want and need a job, but always getting a no is consuming my mental health in so many levels that I am starting to not know how to deal with it.Last month I applied for a internship in L'oreal, it was the dream job for me.

I do not feel like I get comfort from people, and honestly I do not know why I seek it since it is my issue and I got to solve it own my own.

My 17 year old is a narcissistic brat and lives with my parents in another state. My 9 year old is so young. All my kids have great qualities about each of them.

Now I have made a mistake in our marriage, I am not perfect. Neither is he. He was so mean all the time. I felt so terrible and when someone else makes you feel nice, you run towards, even if its wrong. But it has been 17 years since then. I take care of his medications. And I help where I can with appts. I take care of the kids. I work full time, crap hours. I barely function. When I ask for help I am seen as weak. I am trying to not show I am sad at all. I try to be everything to everyone. My oldest has attitude and wants to move out or whatever. I have a great job at the hospital. Its the hours that kill me and give me tremendous mom guilt because I am so tired and try to get some sleep but not everything gets done. I think my co workers like me. I am such a people pleaser. Its nuts. I am not trying to look for compliments. But damn I do so much for everyone, and no one gives a crap. My husband says I am lucky to even be where I am. I would have nothing if it was not for him. The only that would truly miss me is my 9 year old. Because she is the heart of us. The 18 year old would be put in a home if I died. The 20 year old would be pissed but get over it. The 17 year and my parents would be like what took so long? How did she ever live past Robyn? My birth mom. I am adopted by my aunt and uncle. My husbands sister, who I was so there for her when she went through cancer out of no where quit taking to me two years ago. I have not spoken to my parents since my daughter went to live with them. Everyone seems to forget that I am the one they went to for everything. Childcare, money, advice. So I make one mistake, and I am a piece of shit forever? No one helped me when my husband was hitting me. I actually met with my dad at a restaurant. He would not even let me and my kids come home. He said stick it out. So here I am 22 years later. I love my husband. I do sweet things to try and get affection. All I get is what I think he has a girlfriend. I honestly do not care. I just wish I was treated like a person. I work my butt off. My husband spends so much time and effort looking for records he wants to buy. On his phone!!!!! I hate smart phones so much. He is on his so much. I have mentioned before that the whole house is not on a device and no one listens. I really hate how not a single person in my life can actually be nice to me except my disabled daughter, most days.

10546,"Due to a bad childhood, horrible socializing skills as a kid, and other things in between, I fucking suck at emotionally connecting to anyone. I do not have any attachments to my family, since my bad childhood mostly involves them. I only have 4 close friends, and they are amazing ones, but I have only really connected to and opened up to 1. I could easily relate to her and we could talk for hours on end. We took a few month break for her to focus on her mental health. Now that were talking again, it just feels like we lack the connection we use to have. I still cherish her and everything, but sometimes it just feels one sided, but I cannot blame her. She recently got a lot of new friends and just has a busy life in general. My 3 other friends, while close, I have only opened up to one and that was ages ago. When I did, his parents saw my messages, told the school principal who then proceeded to call my mom, which made some issues for me. Ever since then, the only person I have opened up to is the friend I mentioned first. I have talked to her about some of my issues, but I do not want to burden her. She already feels guilty for not being there during our break. My last 2 remaining friends, its hard to open up to since I have never talked to them about this stuff at all, at least on my side. The best thing about the emotional connection I had with my friend originally, was that it made me feel happy unlike anything else. It made me feel like I was living. I still feel that way when we have a fun time with each other or have a good convo, but now its just a double edge sword to me, with the sad feelings that come with it. I do not have anyone else to rely on, to relate to, or anyone there for me. I do not think me and her will ever go back to way that we were before, and that scares me. I would have no connections then. I would just be a sack of flesh walking on this earth. Suicidal ideas have came back. I know I am a wimp when it comes to this stuff, I could not self harm even if I wanted to, but maybe the cowardice will run out sometime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I am a 20yr old male (soon to be 21) that has indeed been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I have dealt with these issues for around 6-8yrs of my life. Part of my anxiety issues is changes in eating habits. Things such as me not eating when get a full blown anxiety attack, feeling some stomach cramps when eating certain foods or eating them in certain locations, and sometimes feeling discomfort when I have a BM but not all the time.

I am writing this because this week has been super stressful causing me to have a few anxiety breakdowns (one major one yesterday). Today is the aftermath and my mind is really letting me have it. As of now I'm hungry which makes me anxious which makes me not eat which makes me feel sick which makes me more anxious. It's perpetual :T

I don't want to keep going through this. I have been to many doctors, have not been given meds and have underwent many tests. I also did go see a therapist for a while but stopped going when my anxiety issues went away.

**my point is**

Should I go back to my psychiatrist, reopen my case and perhaps get medication?

Or perhaps this is seems more like a digestive issue and I should see a gastroenterologist?

Or should I go back to see my therapist?

Or lastly do all three?:&lt;

15440,"Close to midnight rant. I have been strugling with intense feelings and thoughts of despair, hopelesness, hatred, bla bla bla... the good stuff. But I have also had a lot of time to reflect on life, on personal desires, on the state of the world and the kind of people that we ""should"" be.I think we can all agree that current societal norms and stereotypes put a lot of stress on everybody, and they expect to make us less empathetic, be it to friends, peers, the working class, your competition. You have to be a shark, the lone wolf, a champion. Empathy is, I am going to, the key to knowledge about all human-related stuff. If we loose empathy, we loose our connection to humanity.I read your posts: ""nobody listens to me"", ""i do not know who to talk to"", ""fuck this"". Its inmensely relatable and they bear a pattern: a lot of people seek answers in others. Advice, love, a bit of empathy. While these are essential elements in the daily lives of humans, i believe they cannot solve, maybe not even individually begin the process of healing we need. In my experience, advice from my family is quite nice to have, but it becomes meaningless in a matter of hours. Love? It feels fake, not earned, like a convenient lie to ignore the abyss. If stuff like this works for you, that is fantastic! Make it worth your while! But perhaps it is not your case; it just wears out, it does not make you feel better. We need something more personal.there is something in each and every human that is fundamentally unique, confused and disturbed. And like moths we desperately seek some light to find out what is so complicated to understand and appreciate about ourselves. I have felt an inmense fear of never feeling truly comprehended, of not seeing myself completely in another persons eyes, of being more than myself. But such uniqueness cannot be decoded by others. That may be the only place where empathy will never exist, and that is... well, fine. We will never find the answer to what we must do or want solely trough foreign experiences and advice, we must partially rely on what makes us US, memories and fantasies, past and future. Experience. To comprehend and coexist with life, we have to participate in it.Of course, a lot of us hate the mere idea of self improvement or ""soul searching"". After all, we tell ourselves all the time that we are not worth such hassle. And perhaps its also not worth doing it for others. But from where do we take this idea of needing worth or some kind of permission to just think? Should that matter? Why not just say ""fuck it"" in the sense of not caring about what we think of ourselves, because almost nobody really cares? And the few that do already have our backs, either we like it or not!I am not telling you that you should just stop caring about everything, or stop being a coward about introspection, or go cry a river to someone expecting to find ""the answer"". After all, i started this talking about empathy. Hell you can counter-rant me all you want, if it just makes you feel a bit more relaxed. I do not know, i had a weird day and tomorrow i must hand over a lot of work. Just breathe, almost nobody cares, the few that do care will help you if they can, and in the end you just do not know what could happen. What if. I like uncertainty (altough i have terrible luck at UNO haha). Good night, get some rest. We are alone, and that is ok.

I have struggled with depression/social anxiety since I was 11. I have had no friends &amp; no dating experience. Just been alone all my life.At 28yrs old I can finally say I have been making big steps to changing my life. I finally have a best friend, finally been on dates and I finally have been taking risks daily to bettering my mental health and career goals.Today I had a good day until my sister called me to tell me I am a ""piece of shit"" and how my mother is getting older and I am not working or paying at least one of her bills. My brother on his daughters birthday decided to cuss me out just because I was talking about how proud I am of becoming more social and he snapped at me about the same thing when I was the one that had to fund his daughter's birthday party. I also have helped my sister many times with money(savings) while I am unemployed.I broke down and cried today for the first time in a decade because I have talked to them many times about how I want to help our mother out badly and even had numerous of job interviews coming in but yet they still want to beat me down when I am trying my best.I also want to add if I was not depressed they would not have me to lean on whenever they want to go out and leave their kids on me all the time.I do not know what to do I have been tolerating the disrespect just to help get me out of the house and go out with them but now I am done with them and have no one to hang out with.

35712,"It finally got the best of me I have suffered with health anxiety over the past year but it’s been increasingly worse the past few months. This along with the stress I have been under lately has been a disastrous combination. My heart rate has been higher than usual lately along with this weird pain in chest and shoulder,obviously leading me to constantly believe I’m having a heart attack. Also I’ve been somewhat struggling with more intense allergy symptoms. 
I don’t have health insurance so I’ve been trying to just ignore it and chalk it up to stress but of course my mind wonders and then I go to google. The past month alone I’ve convinced myself that I have various heart issues, brain tumors, ALS and so many more. 
So, long story short, yesterday it got the best of me and I had a panic attack and went to urgent care. The nurse practitioner has pretty much decided it’s all stress related but decided to do an EKG and a few blood tests anyway. The EKG came back fine and he says by the look of things I seem pretty healthy. Unfortunately the blood test result won’t be in until Saturday so that’s weighing on me because I’m obviously thinking the worst but he prescribed me some anxiety meds and they have helped slightly. 
But it still sucks to be such a prisoner in my own mind.

My childhood was rough, I always had weight problems, no friends, etc. I think I am the most hideous person on Earth. I used to hate my self so much.I have never had a job I enjoyed. I always dreaded going to these shitty ass jobs. I bust my ass off for them, people tell me I am smart and good at my job but what is the point? there is no promotion no raise. I am stressing myself out working myself to the point of exhaustion for NO REASON. none of this matters it is all so stupid.I felt a glimpse of happiness last year when I got into my first relationship. I gave it my all. I made sacrifices for this person and they broke my heart. Cheated on me. Bullied me. I broke up with them but I still love and miss them so much. I do not see myself being in a relationship anytime soon. Sometimes i feel I will never be as happy as I was last year. Ever again.I am so tired of trying. But at the same time I am tired of being depressed. Its so not fair to end my life and kill myself and let all this bullshit win. Life is too fucking short to live like this all miserable. I am so tired of caring. I am so tired of trying to people please 24/7. Tired of these pointless jobs. I just do not care anymore.I am doing what makes me happy from now on. Imnot fucking busting my ass for this job anymore. While my coworkers are lazy and STILL GET PAID THE SAME AS ME LOL I want to be selfish for once in my life. I want to be happy and I do not fucking care who or what gets in my way I am going to do what I want. I refuse to let all this crap end me. there is so much pressure on us to be perfect. Have the perfect body and face, have a partner, have money, the perfect job. Omg fuck that its sooo stupid. Why do we even have to be those things.I had those things. I had the job the boyfriend had lost weight and I was still fucking miserable. Because I thought i had to follow other peoples idea of perfect and happy. To be happy. But it is such a lie.

34667,"Self-diagnoses, panic attacks, and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection (health anxiety, right?). Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. 

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before.

I am just bored and words will not make me feel better, I actually do not know anymore what happiness or joy mean, I cannot even simulate it with scenarios in my head, it is completely forgotten.I decided to go in the mountains this summer to do some hiking, but in the mean time I am telling myself it could be a good place to leave this world, a big scary jump and it is all done. My brain gave me hope yesterday by giving the first dream in years (I only have nightmares). In this dream, a girl was in love with me, but this never happened irl. It was good, but this dream is also evil because it brings hope, hope is not good, it makes you wait again and again for things to get better they never do. I knew only hate, pure hate from others all my life, that is why I am so nice to people : I am fucking terrified by them, so I am soft, I am nice, I act social while I want that bullet in my head at least once a day.But yeah, mountains could be a good way to go, it is beautiful and I will be eaten by wild animals.I feel pleasure when I say to myself ""I can quit whenever I want"", it is so relaxing. I would love to experience a love story, but I am so innocent and so romantic, while people now are just looking for sex, threesome, foursome... I love my innocence, it is part of me, I am pure about love.

Felt ok the first couple doses but I noticed on the 3rd dose I felt kind of light headed and fuzzy. Took my 4th dose around 10 and about an hour ago got up from the couch and was really dizzy. It seems like it’s a bit better now, I’m not dizzy while sitting anymore. But I googled and started freaking out, some sites say dizziness is a common side effect and some say severe dizziness can be a sign of an allergic reaction. So I started freaking out even more and now I feel like my throat is closing up. I can drink water though, and breathe, so I’m hoping that part is just my anxiety making everything worse.

34856,"How do get over mild hearing loss in right ear? I've been crying and depressed. I've had health anxiety for a long time, but none of my fears have come true until now. It all started when I saw a video of tinnitus sufferers getting a temporary relief. I had no idea what tinnitus was so I googled it. Turns out I have a mild form of that and hearing things when it's quiet is not normal, it's tinnitus. I was shocked since I've had that ALL my life. I remember hearing the ""sound of silence"" AKA the ringing in my ears since I was very young. I was really shocked and scared at that time, since I never noticed this before. But that's not the peak of my misery. I read that tinnitus is often accompanied with hearing loss in any way. I then did countless online tests and always came back with the top score. 

However, I found an app that makes an audiogram of separate ears and how much hearing loss you have in them. I got my results and they said I had mild hearing loss in my right ear in the mid-range frequencies (but not the higher ones). I didn't think much of it at first until I tried blocking each ear individually to see if there was any difference in hearing and now I can hear a magnificent difference. My right hear is more muffled when I block out my left ear and my left ear sounds perfect.

How do I get over this? I got out of my depressive state around 6 months ago and have been doing so good since.. until I noticed all of this. I don't feel normal. I feel like I'm handicapped now and PERMANENTLY. This word is what makes all this so scary.. permanent. Means that I will NEVER hear normally in the right ear and this devastates me. Might devastate me more than the average person since I make music and music used to be a big part of my coping mechanism with depression. Please help how I can get over this, I can't accept that I have hearing loss even though it's mild. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a counselor and I don't want to tell my parents about this.

19849,"On Sunday night I tried to kill myself by hanging. I choked until I passed out, and awoke violently gagging - I ran to the bathroom and threw up, and spent the rest of my night on the bathroom floor. The next morning, I spent my time walking around like a zombie, and when I got home I thought I wanted to try again - I decided to call mental health services and they decided I needed to get myself to the hospital. After realising I am physically ok and there is no permanent damage, I honestly feel lucky to be alive.Depression and suicide have surrounded me for the majority of my adulthood. My dad committed suicide when I was 15, and I do not think I ever fully resolved the trauma from that event. I have consistently felt on and off for the past few years, but my suicidal thoughts culminated on Sunday night and resulted in me trying to take my own life.My ex girlfriend, who I was with for nearly 6 years, came over and repeatedly twisted and manipulated my feelings to the point where Id never felt more sick and used in my life. I begged this person to come back in my life, and I am deeply ashamed - not because of showing feelings, but because I now know that this person has never caused me anything but pain. Over the years, I feel that she conditioned me into complacency, and gradually tore down my personality into the person who was happy to be stuck with someone like that for the rest of their life. Looking back on it now, in a calmer state, and with the perspective that all the loved ones who have come by and supported me have provided, I now realise there is not much of this person I wasted so much time and energy on that actually value or respect. She could not talk or communicate like an adult. She was incapable of seeing the effects of her actions on other people. She was selfish. She made poor decisions, and was incapable of looking after her health and hygiene properly. She had very few friends, and repeatedly drove people away due to her personality. She was always so quick to judge and criticise others, especially me, without ever turning the magnifying glass back on herself. She humiliated my sister about her botched tattoo, despite having an absolute clusterfuck of poorly assembled tattoos mismatched all over her thighs. She hated cheaters and how people functioned in their relationships, yet complained about me to her male friend, and gaslit me into thinking I was crazy for hurting from it. She criticised other peoples health and appearance, yet only continued to gain weight without doing a single thing to change. She often shamed me for how I chose to dress, despite often having pretty poor hygiene and being quite unappealing as a result. I now realise just how much this person had thoroughly poisoned my floor, and convinced me I was not worth anyones time or effort. Begging for her affections is the most regrettable thing I have ever done, because I now realise that this was the ultimate symbol of how she would conditioned me to submit to her disgusting behaviour. As she revealed details of getting drunk and sleeping with someone earlier in the week, despite never wanting to be physical with me at the end, confessed details of drinking alone recently, and went back &amp; forth on getting back together to play with my feelings, I think the veil broke in my mind and I finally started to see her for what she is. This person that I had put so much time and energy into, who I had thought I loved with all of my heart, just uses people and discards them. As I sat in the hospital and received an outpouring of support, I realised just how little she had ever done for me. Id received the most heartwarming messages of love and support from women I had slept with once and kept very poor contact with. If all of these people Id only spent time with for one night, just to get physical, could offer so much support then why could not someone Id know for most of my adult life? She blamed so much of her toxic behavioural and personality traits on past relationships, and even puts her various supposed mental issues in her Tumblr biography as some sort of attention seeking excuse. This person is just a complete fraud and I now realise what an absolute manipulator she was. there is such a huge reason for her lack of success in making genuine friendships, and the gross people she is now seeing are just even more evidence of the fact that she will take anything she can get as long as she can use them for something. She has no dignity or respect in my eyes and I truly regret I let someone like this shape what could have been my last day on this earth. Last night, a complete stranger came up to me and told me as a dad, he felt so much sadness and concern for my well-being that he had to say something. He gave me a hug and told me that he saw how much love I have to give and I should not even be here. After how much crying Id already done that way, I could not believe how much hope I felt in my heart after hearing that from someone who did not even know me. I would need 4 hands to count the number of people who have offered to come over, who have spent time with me today, and just given me a phone call to let me talk and finally express the pain I have carried for so so long. Some of my dearest friends have been so fucking supportive, and understood the pain and abuse I had endured for longer than anyone should have had to bear. I am sure things will not always be easy, and I know there will be times where my thoughts take over and I want to do something terrible. But after the ordeal of the last few days, I finally see the support that I have, and just how much I have going for me despite not realising it. I have made an interstate move happen all on my own, and been approved for my dream apartment. I am going out and meeting people, and (TMI) having really awesome sex after being with the most stale and unfulfilling sexual partner I have ever had. I go to the gym most days of the week now, and find so much enjoyment in working myself physically to improve my health. I put more time into my hobbies today, and found renewed vigour for guitar practice and my music theory work. I am practically drowning in job opportunities and have never felt so excited about the prospects in front of me. There are so many good things on the horizon for me, and one awful person should have never gotten in the way of that.All this is to say, I know that despite things not always going to be easy, I am glad I survived and that I am going to be ok. A lot of the work is on me and it will take a lot of effort, but I know what I need to do. If anyone has ever been in a position like mine, where someone has treated them this way and they feel there is no hope, just know that they are just one person who is trying to project their own shit onto someone else. For every one person like that in your life, you have 30 more who genuinely care and love you and want you to be ok. It was true for me, and I want this to be true to anyone who has gone through what I went through. Attempted suicide on the weekend.

10027,"I really do not understand why I find myself here, suicide is not something I have ever attempted, but it is something I have considered and started considering more and more as time goes on now that I have graduated college.The worst part is I do not think I have any good reason to do it. I am successful in a very well-paying career. I am fairly smart and can apply myself. I am not hot by any means but I am attractive enough to have fairly good options on the dating apps (more on this later). I have a loving, if not smothering family (also more on this later), and a good amount of close online friends and some IRL friends that I still talk to online. I have long-term goals for myself that I want to see happen. It may seem that I have no right to be here, and fuck maybe I do not, but I am still absolutely fucking miserable and some days I wonder why I have not blown my brains out yet. Today's one of those days, for some reason.It really just comes down to my inability to form intimate relationships. I do not really date anymore, for me to be close enough with someone and like them enough to have sex with them is rare since moving back home. I also still live with my extremely obsessive parents in a pretty remote area which makes meeting new people super difficult. All of this leaves me feeling so isolated and behind from everyone, and I am terrified to make any change in my life that could somehow fuck me up worse than where I currently am. Yeah I could afford to rent somewhere but what if that ends up making me more lonely while also burning thousands a month?Work keeps me occupied but the thoughts of ""you are never going to meet someone, get married, have a family, be successful outside of working a 9-5 job, what is the point of you still being here, you will never find more friends and just like some of your college ones the rest will disappear as time goes on"" are getting more and more frequent. it is something I have considered",Suicidal,really understand find suicide something ever attempted something considered started considering time goes graduated college worst part think good reason successful well paying career fairly smart apply hot means attractive enough fairly good options dating apps later loving smothering family also later good amount close online friends irl friends still talk online long term goals want see happen may seem right fuck maybe still absolutely fucking miserable days wonder blown brains yet today one days reason really comes inability form intimate relationships really date anymore close enough someone like enough sex rare since moving back home also still live extremely obsessive parents pretty remote area makes meeting new people super difficult leaves feeling isolated behind everyone terrified make change life could somehow fuck worse currently yeah could afford rent somewhere ends making lonely also burning thousands month work keeps occupied thoughts never going meet someone get married family successful outside working job point still never find friends like college ones rest disappear time goes getting frequent something considered,ကိုယ့်ကိုယ်ကိုသတ်သေမှုသည်အချိန်ကုန်လွန်လာသည်နှင့်အမျှကောင်းမွန်သောအကြောင်းပြချက်ကောင်းကောင်းမွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်သောအ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်များကအညစ်အကြေးများကအံ့သွစရာကောင်းလောက်အောင်ကောင်းသောအရာများအကြောင်းကောင်းကောင်းမွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်သောမိတ်ဆွေများကအံ့အားသင့်စရာကောင်းလောက်အောင်ကောင်းကောင်းမွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်မွန်သောအ 0 တ်အထည်ချုပ်များကတကယ့်ကိုမစွမ်းဆောင်နိုင်ပါ။ အိမ်ပြန်ရောက်သောအခါ Sex Rare သည်အလွန်စွဲမက်ဘွယ်ကောင်းသောမိဘများသည်လူသစ်များနှင့်တွေ့ဆုံခြင်းကိုပြုလုပ်နိုင်သည့်အရာသည်တစ်နေရာရာမှာမတူဘဲတစ်နေရာရာမှာအသည်းအသန်လှည့်ပတ်နေသည့်အရာများ၌မည်သည့်အခါကမျှမတွေ့နိုင်ပါ။

21285,"First I am going to present you with a few questions that you can answer on your own. After I will provide you with what I went through, before I begin, I would like to tell you have severe PTSD but no depression.1) Why are you sad kind soul? Are you not loved? Do you not have a single person in your life who cares so much about you and dislikes reverently to see you upset?2) Why are you allowing other peoples actions and choices to dictate how you feel? Do you not realize the control you have given them over your mind, heart, and choices that only you have the ability to dictate action you make? 7+ billion people in the world and 1 person who you thought cared about you but has proven beyond reasonable doubt they do not, so why do you care what a fraction of a penny to a million dollars thinks?This is why I cannot rationalize depression. Who gives a damn what other people think about you? Not when there is so many people you have yet to meet and get to know who would give their life freely to save your own. Not everyone is this way, why allow people to turn you away from love of someone you never met? Do you not allow them to win at this point in time? Is that not laying down and accepting defeat in every measure. You have given them control over who you are. Break free of it, some people are truly evil scum and this is what they want. They want you to feel worthless, how many people right now can ask a friend this: ""Hey, I feel alone can I talk?"" Personally I do not have it but with online friendships and a few real-life friends. I went from being known in all of California, to being hated by everyone because of slander. So instead of giving up, get back up, do not stop that drive in you to be kind. Suicide is not a answer to any form or self pity, self loathing, or self hatred. Killing yourself will only hurt those who truly care about you. If you die can you share your story? NO! You damn well cannot, so instead of realizing that struggle is growth and growing from a mistake, whether it be from how you may have treated innocent people when you were down and out, or maybe it was how you were treated when you needed a shoulder to cry on? Indifference is not the answer, YOU ARE LOVED BY SOMEONE! PAST, PRESENT, OR FURTURE TENSE! Remember you could be a drive to someone later, a story that if you quit on or recluse on that you have already that that which plagues you win. Life is not easy, let me share 11 years of my life, I know from personal experience that life is difficult. Yet, I refuse to give up, mama did not raise no bitch or a quitter.Sept 17th 2012, prior to that date someone who was called a friend but proven he was not used my name to put a MS13 member in jail facing 1000's of felony charges. That person was facing LIFE in prison without the possibility of parole. I did not know about the hit on my name. A hit is a contract to kill someone. On the above mentioned date, I was overdosing on 26 drugs, Four times the lethal limit. I also had enough acid in my system to because that test result to come back beyond Blood Red. I blew a 3.14 Bac level. The people who did it went against a description to attempt to kill me. I had calico hair and brown eyes, olive skin tone. The description was a white ginger kid with blues eye. They kid napped me and attacked me repeatedly. Well my advise to all, if you want someone unconscious or cooperative why in the hell would it be a good idea to drug them with PCP? In short, I did not feel a thing. They eventually put a gun to my head after three horrific failure attempts to knock me out. Me being me and with who I know told them to "" Do it"". I had them call my closest friends so I knew that in killing me that everyone there would be dead with me. I presented them with this logic, they put the gun back down and decided to try their luck with punches again. Every time they had turned around prior I was being fed information, this time I did not wait I had what I needed. I allowed wrath to hit my voice, they trembled, as the passenger reached for the gun I hit him hard enough to put him in a coma for 7 days. I turned to the driver and present him with two options: drive me to the town near where I lived, OR I will beat you down to a pulp. From knowledge prior that night I knew he had a gun in his door panel (never brag about where you keep loaded guns). He repeatedly kept saying ""OK! OK! I will do it as he reached for the gun and I could see it plain as day. That second the his hand touched the gun I hit with with everything I had. I shattered his right side of his jaw to such a extreme he had to go into surgery to get it fixed. I laid back and felt sick, I am not a fan of harming people and at that point I was exhausted. Thankfully I hit him hard enough that I was able to rest for fifteen minutes and eventually stumble out of the car and run. I came across a Navy personnel who was driving down the road. I ran into of him and screamed for help. Finally, he got out and he said ""what is wrong, what happened?"" I was so exhausted and afraid I could barely tell him. When I managed to he dialed 911. I was taken to the hospital, It took 8 hours with NO Narcan to get it out of my system. I used the restroom twice, had a bottle of Gatorade and a bottle of water to drink. I was not allowed to sleep. I was in psychosomatic state of mind and was not hallucinating prior to being there. When my urine analysis came back I was informed and it hit like a ton of bricks. Walls melted and shifted violently, the floor rose up like ocean waves, I just wanted to be home. I was alone and afraid, no use of my phone was allowed or any phone for that matter. When I talked to the detective in charge of handling the case, I was threatened with if the person I put into a coma died I would face man slaughter charges, that I should be happy that I was not being charged with assault and battery on the person who is jaw I broke, I was still tripping. I pointed out the fact that the evidence gathered from that vehicles dash cam proved it was self-defense.. I got a response of "" I do not care"". Funny because I am 7.4% Balkan and 14.9% Scandinavian. When I told her that she did not like it and said we shall see about that.

I told her my number and she refused to it. I gave her names of everyone there, told her to call Netherland's spec ops who were there to protect me, nothing was done... I told her to her face this ""You are a Cunt, you are a corrupt piece of trash and that I would stop at nothing until I had everyone even remotely affiliated with what had happened dead before a firing squad, even swore to God"".... Well people who know me know I keep promises, especially to God. I finally have called everything into question, now its time for hellfire and brimstone. I should be depressed, I should have so many issues and I truly thank God for getting me through it. Believe in what you want its your choice. This is a factual story and really did happen. It is not all I went through. 11 years of my life dedicated to hunting everyone even remotely affiliated, the more I found out the sicker to my stomach it made me. Raped and child molestation, direct connections to the Federal Government. I never thought for a second it would be that deep. I had no real clue as the truth of how far the rabbit hole went down.

16367,"I am a 19 y.o. who recently lost her mom due to surgery complications. My mom had an arterial bypass in her groin (less than 3% death rate; 95% success rate) and the surgery went fine. After, she could not keep her temp and blood pressure up, and passed away the next morning (were still waiting for her autopsy results.) My mom went under anesthesia and never woke up. She was sedated the whole time, even when she had a wound vac and her incision wide open (the doctor kept it open so he could look later, sewing her up would risk infection.) My mom died with an open incision and a super puffy face. She looked so uncomfortable. She probably contracted sepsis, but that is not what I am here to talk about.Seeing her die made me realize how close and possible it is for me to die any day. I saw her at the funeral home, and she looked nothing like herself. Death scares me now, and its hard for me to believe there is an afterlife. I just wish she is here with me and knows how sorry I am that she had to die like that. I also feel lots of guilt, as I have dealt with depression and anxiety and would take it out on her a lot (we were also best buddies, she loved me more than anything and always told me that.) I just need some peace and I do not know how to not feel angry and guilty. I am an only child and a mamas girl. I have my dad who loves me very much, but my mom was my whole world.

I feel like I am disrespecting and making a mockery of people who have killed themselves because I know if I worked at it I could make this horrid feeling go away. But I am just so tired. Mentally I am completely exhausted. My mum was just diagnosed with yet another serious disease and because her immune system is already weak as hell from her medication it could be potentially fatal. My dad blames her 'bad lifestyle' for it so they are constantly screaming at each other -- they both want a divorce, but cannot afford one. I am so sick of trying to block out the arguing and I do not know what to do anymore. I am probably going to die young anyway because the disease is hereditary and every single female in my mum's bloodline has gotten some form of it. Yeah, I could take medication for the rest of my life, but is it worth it? there is nothing even wrong with me. I got good grades in my mock exams (I am 15 and in secondary school), I have such nice friends but all they seem to do is annoy me now. I know they do not mean to. it is my fault. I am doing stupid shit I never would have done a month ago like taking more painkillers than necessary and walking out of lessons to hide in the toilets until the end of the day. For reference, this time last month I had severe anxiety and would not even speak in lessons. Now I am leaving them without asking and snapping when I do not get my way. I even fucking told a teacher yesterday that I felt like hurting myself, that I felt suicidal, and I had to sit in her office while she called my mum and put the phone on speaker so I heard what she had to say about it. I have stopped looking both ways before I cross the road, stopped caring about what other people think about me, started shutting out everybody who cares, and when I get home I just cry. that is it. Cry and sleep. it is so absurd to me because I read what I am writing and I sound pathetic -- so many people do worse things than this and I feel so wrong for wanting to die but I am just done. I do not know what to do anymore. Anyhow I have one last day of school left before the summer holidays which is 6 weeks long in the UK so that is 6 weeks to do nothing but sit alone and think. My counsellor's calling me after school but I think I might just ignore it. I think I might overdose this summer. it is probably a temporary feeling that will be gone in a few days but I just needed to get it all out y'know? That way if I do end up offing myself in at least my parents will have some idea of what I was feeling when they look through my phone. I am just tired. Scared. I think.

7696,"My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after, an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression, but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know, I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy, that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression, I have no one that talks to me constantly (my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that), and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out, but I want to be alone. I feel nothing - literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now, my room is beyond disgusting, I cannot eat and look like skin and bones, and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. (I am in college now). I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general, let alone the mental healthcare, where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward.

me all the love a child can ask for they were always supportive in all the good thing that i used to do but always very strict about the bad thing when i chose a career path they paid for a private school which i m so grateful for high school wa the best time of my life they supported me in sport i used to be an amateur middleweight boxer i love them both dearly that s why it hurt so much knowing that i m nothing but a disappointment a burden a leech to them i made the worst decision possible after i finished high school i got accepted into the best technical university in my country it is so embarrassing to think back about it now i actually thought it wa an achievement to study i m ashamed to even type this be free to laugh software engineering i can t explain how a person can do something so stupid i only recently found out that most programmer and software engineer with a master degree which only about of student finish make minimum wage if they are lucky i m from the

don t know any foreign language except for english which i m really not good at a you can see and most position require you to know the language of that nation anyway if you want to work in poland you

skill whatsoever the minimum wage here in czechia is not enough to afford even a room apartment so i m either gon na live in my parent basement for the rest of my life or i m gon na end up homeless if they decide to kick me out and probably freeze to death when it get cold but then again i m the only one to blame here i should have been thinking more when choosing a career path it s too late to change my profession now firstly because of all the money that my parent invested into it i feel like cry writing that and secondly because i know deep down that i can only do this that i would be a complete failure trying anything else the moment reality of my situation hit me my life took a bad turn a you can imagine having those thought every day just ravage your mental health i can t sleep properly and there are sequence of day when i don t eat anything i m losing weight i would be a lightweight boxer by now but i stopped training anyway my grade got worse i get feeling of despair and

22440,"there is too much to say and I want to keep this simple. I feel so weak and disconnected from reality. Nothing has ever been ok with me, especially since my dad died five years ago, and then two years ago realizing I have been living a lie. Even long before then, nothing has ever felt normal.I have never felt stable and I do not think I ever will. My social anxiety is so so bad. I feel constantly threatened by everyone when I am out in public; I feel like I could be attacked any moment I am outside somewhere alone.I die inside from people seeing my disgusting outer she will of myself instead of how I have always wanted to be seen. I scream internally from the tragic fact that I have never had a close female friend or a childhood where I could have really grown to be my own womanly self, you know? I feel fucking robbed.I have never kept a job longer than four months in the past five years... because there always comes a point where my social anxiety goes through the roof every time. In one instance, I had a near psychotic episode during which I felt like reaching for a gun. It freaked me because it came out of nowhere. it is sad too because most of them have been part-time jobs. I just feel pathetic because my body cannot handle any amount of manual labor anymore and my mind cannot handle people. I feel so weak and fucked. I hate the fact that we are all cursed to work and throw away the best years of our lives until we can finally retire with less than a couple decades to enjoy the rest of our weakened crippled existence. I do not like work and I do not like it period. I am almost at the point where I am considering crime or something. Maybe I can go wreck something and scream at the top of my lungs and get myself sent to a psych ward; maybe that could get me disability... probably not. Maybe injure and permanently handicap myself. I am just desperate ok? I should have never been stripped of the disability I was getting up until I turned 18 (I was diagnosed with mild autism so that is why I was getting it, but they removed my eligibility the moment I became a legal adult... even though they should not have because, if anything I am way more fucked up and disabled now). You want to know what I like? What my passion is? The only thing in the entire universe that sets my heart aflame? it is writing, but not just *writing*: it is writing these sci fi/fantasy stories I have been having in my head since childhood. (I do not ever want to **work** as a writer because making it a standard job would kill my only passion forever and if that is gone then I am definitely gone..)So yeah, I have always wanted to make a series of graphic novels based on these childhood stories of mine. And I feel so stupid for not getting serious about it till a couple months ago. I am writing a thousand words a day just to practice and to hopefully improve as time goes on. I have been paying a wonderful artist bits of my dwindling money to make these beautiful concept arts of my main characters... this is what makes me still feel alive. To share my stories. I do not even care if I make that much money out of it. I can be poor the rest of my life and if one or two people like my story, my life is complete. But it is so hard to maintain my hope. I feel like I am treated like shit with every job I attempt. I currently looking at a sign spinner job lol which seems promising. it is crazy though... I do not ask for much (just a few hours a day, like 3 or 4, preferably 3... I do not want to work longer than I typically write each day) and yet the world seems to ask too much of my fucked up self.... My money is running out and I hope I find something tolerable. Because I am getting closer and closer to just wanting a car to hit me or something. Do I want to commit suicide? I do not know.

20808,"Hello, 23 year old male here. My parents had divorced I was about 10, dad had moved back to USA. My older brother, sister, and I stayed with our mother in Italy. We had a basically functional family. I guess my problems started about age 12. As it turned out both my brother and I were sort of ""gay adjacent"". Brother was 15 at the time. I guess we were watching porn at the time and we became physical. It kept going on for several months. I was more than okay with what was happening. Was it just fun, a crush, was I in love with him, or did I just worship my older brother? I am not sure but I never thought of it as wrong or rapey or anything. So one night I am blowing him and our sister catches us and immediately tells our mother and the next day my brother is on a flight to live with our dad in another country.I told my parents that he did not force me etc etc etc but they did not care. Molestation they said. Rape they said. Trying to gaslight us. After that and to this day I have not said a single word to either of my parents or my sister. Complete silence. I would talk to my best friend and my brother on the internet when we could. When we would switch parents my brother would already be gone on a flight to the other one, I never got to see him in person again. His car was hit by another car and he died when he was 19.I feel trapped, unable to move on from the night we got caught and what happened after. I have never felt guilty about what we did even though all this happened. I do absolutely blame the rest of the family for what happened, for taking my brother from me and trying to make him feel like he hurt me.So here I am now, living in the US, have a job, I have dated some but never got attached.

I tested at 5.5 weeks. Negative. 3 other tests later. Negative. I have just ordered my final test at 12 weeks. I know it’s probably unnecessary but I just need to do it to be able to move on. 

Funnily enough, this is happened before. 3 weeks after a risk where my doctor said that HIV transmission “just doesn’t happen this way”, I absolutely freaked. Cue two negative tests and 1.5 years of worry and not fully believing I was HIV negative.

35521,"UTI...or not So I woke up on Friday having very mild symptoms of a uti, just a tiny bit of burning after peeing. I immediately drank a ton of water to flush. Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and it’s still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately, my regular doctor isn’t in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor that’s in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember (I’ve gone here for over 10 years) they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave, keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I don’t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? It’s better to be safe. Anyways, she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins. 

The nurse comes back in saying I won’t have the result for three days and I’m confused so I call in the doctor. And she said there’s no harm in taking it even if you don’t have it. This goes against what my usual doctor says, she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. 
Especially when it comes to a urine culture. Because of resistant bacteria or something. 
Anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didn’t ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. Like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. She didn’t even ask if I was sexually active or not or if I was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. 
But I was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as it’s not what I’m used to. 
So I have the medication but you know, me being anxious I don’t want to take it unless I have the results of the culture. At some moments it feels like I’m just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. I quit using the regular soap I was using down there but I stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. 

But sometimes I think omg did I just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. Or regular body sensations freak me out. I’m really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things :/ ",Anxiety,uti woke friday mild symptoms uti tiny bit burning peeing immediately drank ton water flush afterwards burning barely noticeable know still saturday morning wake still barely noticeable still make doctors appointment unfortunately regular doctor day neither usual back book doctor clinic long could remember gone years usually give results urine sample leave keep mind reason went convinced thing could uti perhaps something worse even though know symptoms never right better safe anyways comes explain problem first mentions could irritation mentions something particular dry nether regions thought wow could actually cut overwashed wave relief washed tend overwash use scented products said would prescribe medication uti left nurse came minutes later whole thing took mins nurse comes back saying result three days confused call doctor said harm taking even goes usual doctor says never suggests taking anything unnecessarily especially comes urine culture resistant bacteria something anyways left picked medicine occurred ask many questions left thinking could something else like cut yeast infection incredibly washed even ask sexually active symptoms period due also shock impersonal visit felt used medication know anxious want take unless results culture moments feels like irritated given happened week leading events quit using regular soap using stilll used rest body slips burn sometimes think omg tiny muscle pain back infection regular body sensations freak really trying relax mind keeps racing sorts things,သောကြာနေ့ညနေရောင်ခြည်စွမ်းအင်သုံးညွန်းကအများအားဖြင့်ပုံမှန်မဟုတ်သောညစာစားပွဲသည်များသောအားဖြင့်ပုံမှန်မဟုတ်သောညစာစားပွဲကိုမမှတ်မိသေးသောအ 0 တ်အထည်များကမိုးရေချိန်များ၌မသင့်တော်သောအရာသည်များသောအားဖြင့်ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သောအနေဖြင့်ပုံမှန်မဟုတ်သောညစာစားပွဲကိုသတိမပြုမိဘဲနေသည့်အရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအနေဖြင့်ပိုမိုကောင်းမွန်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောစိတ်ထဲတွင်မရှိတော့သောအရာသည်မသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမလွယ်ကူပါ WOW သည်အလွန်အကျွံသောက်သုံးခြင်းများကိုပြန်လည်ထူထောင်ခြင်းမပြုလုပ်ခဲ့သည့်အရာသည်မသင့်လျော်သောအရာသည်မသင့်လျော်သောအရာများ၌အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုမပြောနိုင်သည့်အရာများ၌အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုယူဆောင်လာသည့်အရာများ၌အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုယူဆောင်လာသည့်အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုယူဆောင်လာခဲ့သည့်အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုဆက်လက်ယူဆောင်လာသည့်အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုမပြောနိုင်သည့်အရာများစွာကိုခေါ်ဆောင်သွားသည့်အရာတစ်ခုခုကိုမပြောနိုင်သည့်အရာသည်မသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာသည်မသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာကမသင့်တော်သောအရာများစွာကိုမပြောနိုင်ပါ ရောဂါလက္ခဏာများကာလအတွင်းထိတ်လန့်သောဆေးများခံစားခဲ့ရသည့်အပန်းဖြေမှုများကို အသုံးပြု. ပုံမှန်ဆပ်ပြာပြုလုပ်ခြင်းကိုပုံမှန်ပြုလုပ်သောအရာဖြစ်ရပ်များသည်ပုံမှန်အားဖြင့်ပုံမှန်စားသောက်ဆိုင်များကို အသုံးပြု. ပုံမှန်အားဖြင့်ပုံမှန်အားဖြင့်ပုံမှန်ခန္ဓာကိုယ်ခံစားချက်များကိုလောင်ကျွမ်းစေသောပုံမှန်ခန္ဓာကိုယ်၏နာကျင်မှုများကမလွယ်ကူပါ

12114,"Hey there folk, friendly neighborhood rant here. cannot promise it will be reader-friendly in terms of like formatting or timeline, but I will try my best. That being said, here goes.&amp;#x200B;Okay so this whole thing starts when I was about 11, mormon, living in California, and my parents were getting divorced. My mother left me with my father, who was too depressed to even get out of bed, for 2 weeks. She comes back for my sister's wedding, and we move to Indiana. In Indiana, my mother and my other sister (s2) decide that they are going to ""co-parent"" me more or less. S2 is pretty much just unlikable in every way. She is the type of person to gaslight you into thinking you are not depressed (we will get to that). Then, after about a year or two in that living situation, the ""Strawberry Incident"" occurred. This is when S2's mother asked me if I felt like cutting some strawberries, and I replied that I did not. I was then forced to do muscle failure for a week straight. After that occurred, I began to realize that the family I have may not be the best for me. Fast forward to about a year later. My father moves out to live with S2. One day, I was getting back from a temple trip to Indy and I had a confrontation with S2. I told her how I felt and said I was not sorry. I then went to talk to my father and he called me a ""Selfish Cocksucker"". That one always stuck. Flash forward one more year, and I am in 8th grade. I am having trouble mentally and had planned my own offing. I was going to do it the night of a concert for my school band. A teacher ended up finding out and told my mom. She then turned it into me trying to actively harm her. I was then sent to a mental hospital wherein I was sexually assaulted by my roommates. When I get back, S2 tells me that I was not really depressed because she would have known. &amp;#x200B;\-INTERMISSION-Hey there here is a little break from the madness. I hope you are having a good day. Anyways, let us dive back in.\-END OF INTERMISSION-&amp;#x200B;After that, I have a pretty uneventful time up until about the end of my freshman year. I had ended up overdosing on my antidepressants and told my best friend, W. Me and W went into a stairwell and we called the crisis hotline, thinking it would be the last call I make. W and I had planned to sing ""Wonderwall"" in our school's talent show. I had ended up being hospitalized again before being able to preform with him. I still feel terrible. Later on, I was with my mother in a taco bell drive thru, and the only thing I remember her saying is ""Why should I care about you when you treat me the way you do."". After a few weeks, cue a family party. I was on an LGBT site that I used to frequent (I think it was a mightynetwork site, I do not really remember all that well.) and also doing my schoolwork. S2 looks over to see what I was doing, and I showed her my schoolwork. She got suspicious of me, and asked to see my iPad. I refused, not wanting her to find out I was a member of the LGBT. She then escalates it, and we end up outside. I tell her that she is an active contributor to my depression, and she says that I do not have it. The next parts are extremely hazy, but I do remember her pushing me to the ground. I still refuse to give her my iPad password, so she threatens to call the police. In retrospect, I still would have kept it from her. After that, my brother in law ends up getting it from me and looks through my profile, finding out that I was Abrosexual. He then laughs at me, and offers me a cigar and beer to ""cool off"". Fun stuff. So after those events, I just cry myself to sleep and that is that. W ends up moving to the next town's school for our sophomore year and beyond. I have a new confidant, D. D and I go to the school counselor together to try to fix my living situation, and I am eventually told to go to the office one day. My principal, thinking I was in a gay relationship with D, called me a ""sick bastard"", and changes mine and D's schedules, so that we no longer have classes together. Somewhere along that timeline, in my freshman year, my dad dies. I am forced into sitting in a hospice room, awake, with my dying father for 12 hours. Flash forward to now. Going into my senior year. I am scared of letting anything show to my mom and getting hospitalized and not being able to go on my germany trip next year. I just want to know what to do.

Diabetes, HIV, throat/tongue/mouth cancer, MS, lupus, overactive thyroid and sjogrens syndrome. 

Yup, it's been a tough few months, I've lost so much sleep thinking about how I'm going to tell my friends and family, will I have to move back home to die? But I'm so young, this is so unfair? 

I'm still struggling, but for the past week I've stopped googling and honestly, it has helped. I still get the thoughts and worries, but by not googling they do not manifest in my mind as much. 

My doctor has diagnosed me with something though, and that something is anxiety. I think it's important to remember that anxiety does have LOADS of physical symptoms (over 100!) and can affect people in different ways. A website I find useful (I know, no googling but this is different, right) is; https://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms.shtml 

I've been lurking on this sub for the past month or so, and can really relate to posts here on a daily basis. It's somewhat comforting to know you're not alone with these crazy thoughts. 

If anyone is struggling and wants someone to talk to, my DMs are open 😁 have a great week everybody.

I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

34704,"21M,FIRST TIME HERE, THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP GIVEN TO ME. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before, I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others , I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings, I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short and for some reason it has caused me to question myself asking "" I wonder if this is cancer causing?"" or "" what if I also get cancer one day?"" almost as if I have some sort of health anxiety and this is becoming an everyday moment, as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father, also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has  recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people, there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high, this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.

To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions, not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper, I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me, where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very good-looking individual and in playful ways people have said"" You love yourself don't you"" or "" you are so cocky"" as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can, the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy, having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier.

34297,"Throat Issues/Fears This is my first time posting on this subreddit... I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then, I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouth/throat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps, and they were found to be nothing. 

For the last week and a half, I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain, but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though, I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilage/bone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge, and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain, and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is, or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. 

My fiancé is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all, and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though, and really looking for advice/help on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately, and just looking for some support. Any thoughts, help or support would be much appreciated.

23192,"Being in the class of 2020 I always thought that my life would lead me to either joining The military or going to college. However, when the pandemic hit everything in my life turned upside down. I lost friends, I lost family and I lost myself. For starters, I would go to the recruiting office every day, because my recruiter would call me fat and dumb if I did not show up. I remember specifically one day I gained 1 pound after losing 15 for her. And when she found out about that one pound she put me on a water diet where I only drink liquids. However this dinner because I gained some of the weight back. From that point on, I knew she starts to lose hope when I have seen her talk to my other friends about me. From there I caught Covid, and could not leave my bed for a whole month. And When I went back to the recruiting office, I saw more as a faker than a human being. Moving forward, from that point on we had a chat, and she told me straight up that I would not do anything good in my life, and she said that the army is the only good thing for me. That night I starved myself from June 25-29 hoping to get skinnier to show her that I was right. However, I found out the hard way, that it did not help but made my weight worse. It has now been a year since I starved myself. However nothing has changed, I had a sit down with my family, About how I want to do college and try it out, so I can have a back plan. Except for being met with all right feedback, I was met with feedback that made my thoughts worsen. From calling me a retard to me getting told I will never be good enough . Sadly every time I try to bring this up, either call me names to stop the conversation or hide my paperwork of colleges.

16308,"As I type this, I have no idea where I am going to begin. I am going to press enter twice and type everything on my mind. This could be the last thing I write.Numbness is one of the most consistent things in my life so far. Ever since I was young, panic attacks and depression, possibly PTSD always stayed with me. Everyone knew me, but who really knew *me?* I slid away to bathrooms when I needed to cry. When I felt a panic attack coming on, I always found myself on the closet floor. Solitude was what I needed to get through the tough times. I find myself here again in a familiar place. A room. Any room. A room where I am alone. A room where, amidst all of the rooms, I simply exist. And it does not feel like much more.I have to say that I did think that I have changed. I look back though, and I have nothing to show for it. I never really could see a future for myself. If you were to ask me when I was 18 where I would be when I was 23 (how old I am now), I would not have known. I always felt out of place. Even the times where I am in place, I know it is temporary.The worst thing to ever happen to me was losing my ability to feel emotions. I want to cry. I want to cry and mourn the things that have happened to me, things that I continue to push through. I do not want to be strong anymore. Even when I am feeling weak I am forced to be strong because I cannot feel my emotions or cry for more than ten seconds without forcing myself.I do not want to be strong and have someone make me feel weak. I do not want to give anyone the benefit of the doubt anymore. I do not want to have a good time until I am shot down. I do not want to have to look at my debts, wonder how I am even going to pay them and buy weed instead. I am tired of not being able to afford a therapist. I am tired of not having anyone to go to. I am tired of being the person to go to for your problems even when I never tell you mine. I am tired of being the person to always listen instead of being listened to. I am so fucking tired of being talked to like I am stupid. I am tired of being stuck in a cycle. I am tired of talking to people I do not want to talk to. I am tired of seeing black people suffer. I am tired of trying my best for not much in return... I am tired of thinking of so many things that make me tired.it is exhausting to be tired. I want to sleep and never be tired again. I thought I was doing better until I was not. that is how it always happens. Sneak attack. Sometimes when I would have a good day, I would think, ""I never would have had this good day if I had killed myself. I hope in the future I do not kill myself."" I do not even remember what the good days were.I do not know what they will be. I do not know if I want to wait around and find out. it is clear to me that, at 23 years old, this is life for me. No matter how much my circumstances change, no matter how much I change, I will always be the same in the same ways that I do not want to be the same. I always thought it would magically get better. Now I am typing this for strangers to read even though it does not matter. Nothing does and everything is bullshit suffering for no reason. we are all selfish viruses aiming to work ourselves to death for a society that will not even pay for our deaths. If I offed myself right now, my family would get a bill for $3000 for transportation of my body alone. Fuck you, America. Fuck everyone else too while I am at it.
